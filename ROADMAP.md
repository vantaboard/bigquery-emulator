# BigQuery Emulator Roadmap

This document tracks the implementation roadmap for `bigquery-emulator`, a
locally-runnable emulator of the BigQuery REST API. The architecture is
deliberately modeled on Google's [`cloud-spanner-emulator`][spanner]:

- The **engine is C++** and links GoogleSQL directly. GoogleSQL is the
  source of truth for SQL parsing, name resolution, type inference, and
  analysis. Execution sits behind a single `Engine` interface and is
  split into local strategies — DuckDB fast path, DuckDB UDFs /
  rewrites, a local semantic executor, and catalog/control handlers —
  chosen per resolved-AST shape by a local execution router. We do not
  re-port any of GoogleSQL to Go.
- The **frontend is a Go HTTP server** that implements BigQuery's public REST
  surface (projects/datasets/tables/jobs/queries/insertAll/...) and forwards
  query work to the C++ engine over an internal gRPC channel.
- The Go gateway spawns the C++ engine binary as a subprocess on startup and
  shuts it down on exit, identical to the Spanner emulator's
  `gateway_main` -> `emulator_main` pattern.
- Everything runs **local-only**. There is no fallback to the real
  BigQuery service; coverage and parity are responsibilities the
  multi-strategy coordinator owns inside this process.

## Execution plans

The remaining unscoped work is the **local multi-strategy execution
coordinator** — building out the route classifier and the per-route
executors (DuckDB fast path, DuckDB UDF/polyfill library, semantic
executor, control-op executor) so every shape the analyzer accepts has
a planned route disposition with conformance coverage. The execution
order, terminology, done criteria, and per-route plans live under
[`.cursor/plans/`](.cursor/plans/); start with the index:

- [`.cursor/plans/local-execution-roadmap-index.plan.md`](.cursor/plans/local-execution-roadmap-index.plan.md) — execution order across the local-execution plan set, with route vocabulary, done criteria, and the rule that every user-visible shape gets a routing disposition plus conformance coverage.

The earlier DuckDB-only transpiler plan set (one plan per AST family,
all targeting DuckDB SQL lowering) has been retired. Its landed
accomplishments — scans, filters, projections, joins, aggregates,
windows, set operations, struct / array literals, JSON field access,
Arrow output — carry forward as `duckdb_native` / `duckdb_rewrite`
entries in the new tracker. The earlier 46-plan capability-area
scaffold (one plan per gateway / engine / storage / conformance
slice) was retired before that.

## Engine and storage

The C++ side is structured around two narrow interfaces
(`backend/engine/engine.h`, `backend/storage/storage.h`) so the heavy
machinery can be swapped without touching the gateway, the gRPC
contract, or the conformance harness. Today there is exactly one
public implementation behind each interface; the `Engine`
implementation is itself a local **multi-strategy coordinator** that
routes resolved-AST shapes to the right local executor.

- **`Engine` interface — local execution coordinator**
  (`backend/engine/`). Owns a route classifier that consults the
  shape tracker for each resolved-AST node kind and dispatches to one
  of:

  - **DuckDB fast path** (`backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/`): emits
    DuckDB-flavored SQL via a custom C++ AST visitor/unparser and
    executes through DuckDB's C++ client. Owns the OLAP-shape wins —
    scans, filters, projections, joins, aggregates, windows, set
    operations, struct / array literals, JSON field access, Arrow
    output.
  - **DuckDB rewrites and UDFs** (planned): DuckDB SQL expressed in
    terms of UDFs / macros / structural rewrites for the BigQuery
    functions whose semantics are close enough to DuckDB's that they
    can be made correct locally without a separate executor.
  - **Local semantic executor** (planned): a row/array/value
    interpreter that runs against scanned Arrow batches when the
    BigQuery semantics differ enough from DuckDB to make a rewrite
    risky (exact NULL behavior, BigQuery-specific date arithmetic
    edge cases, SAFE-mode error surfaces, deep STRUCT mutation,
    `UNNEST WITH OFFSET`, multi-array zip, ...).
  - **Catalog / control ops** (planned for full coverage): DDL,
    metadata, and other "this is really a storage / catalog
    operation" statements bypass query execution entirely and run
    through the storage layer.

  Each strategy returns rows through the same `RowSource`
  abstraction; callers cannot tell which one served a query (the
  conformance harness can, via route labels).

- **`Storage` interface — DuckDB storage** (`backend/storage/duckdb/`).
  A single `catalog.duckdb` file under `--data_dir` (default
  `$HOME/.bigquery-emulator`) holds the catalog and all table rows;
  the engine reads and writes through DuckDB's C++ client. Survives
  restarts and gives users a real local data warehouse.

An earlier iteration carried a second `Engine` implementation
(ReferenceImpl, on top of `googlesql::reference_impl::Evaluator`)
bridged to DuckDB by a `FallbackEngine` wrapper, plus an in-memory
storage backend for hermetic tests. Both were removed once DuckDB
covered the supported surface; the new multi-strategy coordinator
is the deliberate replacement for that pattern, with route
selection happening at AST-classification time rather than at
runtime error catch time. See `docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md` for the
current execution policy and the deprecation rationale.

The point of this roadmap is to keep the work bite-sized, ordered by
dependency, and honest about what is "in" vs. "vendored from upstream."

## Repo bootstrap

Goal: a buildable skeleton that runs an empty HTTP server and an empty C++
gRPC engine, with the gateway lifecycle wiring them together.

- ✅ Repository scaffold
  - `binaries/gateway_main/main.go` (Go entrypoint)
  - `binaries/emulator_main/main.cc` (C++ entrypoint)
  - `gateway/` Go package (HTTP server + subprocess manager)
  - `frontend/server/` C++ gRPC server
  - `backend/` C++ catalog + storage + engine layer
  - `proto/emulator.proto` + `proto/storage_read.proto` (internal
    contract between Go and C++)
  - `Taskfile.yml` + `taskfiles/<namespace>.yml`, `Makefile`,
    `BUILD.bazel`, `MODULE.bazel`
  - `.gitignore` (excludes the local `cloud-spanner-emulator/` reference clone)
  - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ Dockerfile that builds both binaries reproducibly
  (multi-stage; the canonical Bazel `engine-builder` stage links
  GoogleSQL + DuckDB; the runtime stage ships
  `bigquery-emulator-gateway` + `bin/emulator_main` +
  `bin/libduckdb.so` and mirrors `gcr.io/cloud-spanner-emulator/emulator`)
- ✅ CI: GitHub Actions workflows for build/test/lint (`ci.yml`),
  Docker smoke (`docker-smoke.yml`), conformance fixtures
  (`conformance.yml`), third-party client samples
  (`thirdparty-samples.yml`), GoogleSQL parity + prebuilt artifact
  (`googlesql-parity.yml`, `googlesql-prebuilt.yml`), coverage
  publish (`coverage-bazel.yml`, `coverage-publish.yml`), and
  tag-triggered release (`release.yml`). Linux/amd64 only — the
  GoogleSQL hermetic LLVM toolchain does not cross-build cleanly
  to linux/arm64 yet (see "Build systems" below)

## Gateway HTTP surface (Go)

Goal: every BigQuery REST endpoint a client library expects has a
route registered. The core CRUD + query surface
(`projects` / `datasets` / `tables` / `tabledata` / `jobs` /
`queries`) is implemented end-to-end against the C++ engine; the
peripheral surfaces (`models`, `routines`, `rowAccessPolicies`,
`migration`, `dataTransfer`) are wired as structurally-valid stubs
so client-library startup probes succeed and per-method behavior
is per-row in [`docs/REST_API.md`](./docs/REST_API.md).

The canonical, always-up-to-date mapping from BigQuery v2 REST endpoints
to the handlers in this repo lives in [`docs/REST_API.md`](./docs/REST_API.md);
that document is cross-referenced against the upstream documentation under
[`docs/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/`](./docs/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/).

- ✅ Health checks (`GET /`, `GET /healthz`) — emulator-only, not part of the
  public BigQuery API
- ✅ Project routes
  - `GET /bigquery/v2/projects` (`projects.list`)
  - `GET /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/serviceAccount`
    (`projects.getServiceAccount`) — note: there is **no**
    `GET /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}` endpoint in the public API
- ✅ Dataset routes (`bigquery.datasets.*`)
  - list / get / insert / patch / update / delete / undelete
  - `datasets.undelete` is `POST .../datasets/{datasetId}:undelete` (AIP-136
    custom method); dispatched on the trailing `:undelete` because Go's
    mux can't match a literal segment after a wildcard
- ✅ Table routes (`bigquery.tables.*`)
  - list / get / insert / patch / update / delete
  - IAM: `getIamPolicy`, `setIamPolicy`, `testIamPermissions` — all three
    are `POST .../tables/{tableId}:operation` custom methods, dispatched
    the same way as `datasets.undelete`
- ✅ Tabledata routes (`bigquery.tabledata.*`)
  - `GET .../tables/{tableId}/data` (`tabledata.list`)
  - `POST .../tables/{tableId}/insertAll` (`tabledata.insertAll`)
- ✅ Job routes (`bigquery.jobs.*`)
  - `GET /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs` (`jobs.list`)
  - `POST /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs` (`jobs.insert`, metadata)
  - `POST /upload/bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs` (`jobs.insert`,
    media upload — multipart/resumable per the upstream
    [`api-uploads.md`](./docs/bigquery/docs/reference/api-uploads.md))
  - `GET /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs/{jobId}` (`jobs.get`)
  - `POST /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs/{jobId}/cancel`
    (`jobs.cancel`)
  - `DELETE /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs/{jobId}/delete`
    (`jobs.delete`) — the literal `/delete` suffix is the upstream URL
    template, not a typo
- ✅ Query routes
  - `POST /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/queries` (`jobs.query`)
  - `GET /bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/queries/{jobId}`
    (`jobs.getQueryResults`)
- ✅ Discovery doc
  - `GET /discovery/v1/apis/bigquery/v2/rest`
- ✅ Models / Routines / RowAccessPolicies / Migration / Data
  Transfer routes registered as wired stubs so client-library
  startup probes (list / get / delete sample loops) succeed; the
  per-method status lives in [`docs/REST_API.md`](./docs/REST_API.md)
- ✅ JSON error envelope matches the documented BigQuery shape
  (`{"error": {"code", "message", "status", "errors": [...]}}`); see
  [`docs/bigquery/docs/error-messages.md`](./docs/bigquery/docs/error-messages.md)
  for the canonical sample response and reason codes
- ✅ Authn middleware: parses but ignores bearer tokens
  (emulator-style), attaches a synthetic
  `emulator@bigquery.local` principal to every request, never
  returns 401 ([`gateway/middleware/auth.go`](./gateway/middleware/auth.go));
  honors `BIGQUERY_EMULATOR_HOST` env-var conventions on the client
  side
- ✅ SQL dialect posture: `useLegacySql=true` rejected with HTTP
  400 + `reason: invalidQuery` before any engine work; unset and
  `false` treated as GoogleSQL
  ([`gateway/handlers/queries.go`](./gateway/handlers/queries.go))
- ✅ Result wire encoding follows
  [`StandardSqlDataType.TypeKind`](./docs/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/StandardSqlDataType.md)
  exactly: `INT64`/`NUMERIC`/`BIGNUMERIC` are decimal strings, `FLOAT64`
  is JSON number with `"NaN"`/`"Infinity"` sentinels, `BYTES` is base64,
  `TIMESTAMP`/`DATE`/`TIME`/`DATETIME` are RFC 3339, `STRUCT` is a
  positional list, etc. (see the type table in `docs/REST_API.md`)

## Internal gRPC contract (Go <-> C++)

Goal: nail down the wire format the gateway uses to talk to the engine. This
is what isolates the messy "compile GoogleSQL" question from the "implement
BigQuery REST" question.

- ✅ [`proto/emulator.proto`](./proto/emulator.proto) v0
  - `Catalog` service: `RegisterDataset`, `RegisterTable`, `DropDataset`,
    `DropTable`, `DescribeTable`
  - `Query` service: `ExecuteQuery(QueryRequest) -> stream QueryResultRow`
    + `DryRun(QueryRequest) -> DryRunResult` (for `jobs.query` with
    `dryRun=true`)
- ✅ [`proto/storage_read.proto`](./proto/storage_read.proto) —
  internal Storage Read API contract served by the engine on its
  gRPC port (`bigquery_emulator.v1.StorageRead`)
- ✅ Generate Go bindings (`buf generate`) — output under
  [`gateway/enginepb/`](./gateway/enginepb/)
- ✅ Generate C++ bindings (Bazel `proto_library` + `cc_grpc_library`
  rules in [`proto/BUILD.bazel`](./proto/BUILD.bazel))
- ✅ Health + readiness check (`grpc.health.v1`), served by
  `emulator_main`
- ✅ Gateway helper that retries until engine reports SERVING
  before the gateway opens its public listener
  ([`gateway/gateway.go`](./gateway/gateway.go))

## Catalog, Storage, and Engine abstractions (C++)

Goal: define the two pluggable interfaces, ship the DuckDB
implementation of `Storage`, ship the local-coordinator `Engine`
impl (today: DuckDB fast path; the route classifier + DuckDB
UDF/polyfill library + semantic executor + control-op executor land
incrementally behind the same interface — see the Execution
strategies section below), and wire `tabledata.insertAll` /
`tabledata.list` end-to-end against `DuckDBStorage`. The interfaces
stay narrow so additional internal strategies (or, eventually, an
alternate storage layout) can land without disturbing the gateway
or the gRPC contract; today there is exactly one public impl
behind each, and the multi-strategy coordinator is the only
`Engine` implementation callers see.

### Interfaces

- ✅ [`backend/storage/storage.h`](./backend/storage/storage.h):
  `Storage` interface (`CreateTable`, `DropTable`, `GetSchema`,
  `AppendRows`, `ScanRows`, plus row-restriction pushdown for the
  Storage Read API path)
- ✅ [`backend/engine/engine.h`](./backend/engine/engine.h):
  `Engine` interface (`Analyze`, `DryRun`,
  `ExecuteQuery(resolved_ast, catalog) -> RowSource`)

### Storage implementation

- ✅ Vendor `libduckdb` v1.5.3 via Bazel `http_archive`
  ([`third_party/duckdb/`](./third_party/duckdb/)); the engine links
  the prebuilt `libduckdb.so` (linux/amd64 zip) and surfaces its
  Arrow APIs to the build
- ✅ [`backend/storage/duckdb/`](./backend/storage/duckdb/):
  `DuckDBStorage` impl backed by a single `catalog.duckdb` file
  under `--data_dir` (default `$HOME/.bigquery-emulator`). Catalog
  + table rows persist across restarts; the per-dataset directory
  layout / external Parquet drop-in is on the open-questions list
  rather than the active surface

### Schema and DDL mapping

- ✅ [`backend/schema/`](./backend/schema/): dataset / table / column /
  type metadata, conversion to/from
  `google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableSchema` and to DuckDB schema strings
  (`backend/schema/googlesql_to_bq.{h,cc}`)
- 🟡 BigQuery DDL routed to the control-op executor: `CREATE TABLE`,
  `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, `DROP TABLE`, and `ANALYZE` flow through
  `backend/engine/control/control_op_executor.{h,cc}` and mutate
  `Storage` directly (no longer through the DuckDB SQL evaluator).
  `ALTER TABLE` still lowers through the DuckDB transpiler pending
  its own migration; `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` (full
  refresh), `EXPORT DATA`, function registration, partitioning /
  clustering hints, and direct external-Parquet drop-in still
  pending

### Catalog wiring

- ✅ `Catalog` gRPC handlers backed by `DuckDBStorage`
  (`frontend/handlers/catalog.{h,cc}`)
- ✅ `tabledata.insertAll` end-to-end (Go REST ->
  [`gateway/handlers/tabledata.go`](./gateway/handlers/tabledata.go) ->
  engine gRPC -> `DuckDBStorage`); used by the conformance harness
  as the canonical seeding path while DML INSERT is still
  UNIMPLEMENTED on the DuckDB engine
- ✅ `tabledata.list` end-to-end (paginated reads, Arrow-batched
  scans on `DuckDBStorage`)

### Engine scaffolding

- ✅ [`backend/engine/duckdb/`](./backend/engine/duckdb/): the DuckDB
  fast path. The transpiler + DuckDB execution surface is the only
  routed strategy with substantial production coverage today; per-shape
  dispositions are tracked in
  [`backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/SHAPE_TRACKER.md`](./backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/SHAPE_TRACKER.md)
  using the route-aware status vocabulary
  (`duckdb_native`, `duckdb_rewrite`, `duckdb_udf`,
  `semantic_executor`, `control_op`, `unsupported`)
- 🟡 Local execution router behind `backend/engine/engine.h`: dispatches
  each query to the strategy that fits its resolved-AST shape. The
  scaffolding plan is `engine-router-foundation.plan.md`; today the
  router degenerates to "always DuckDB fast path" and shapes not in
  the `duckdb_native` set surface `UNIMPLEMENTED`
- ⏳ Local semantic executor scaffolding
  (`semantic-executor-core.plan.md`)
- ⏳ DuckDB UDF / polyfill library
  (`duckdb-polyfill-udf-library.plan.md`)
- ⏳ Control-op executor for DDL / metadata
  (`control-op-executor.plan.md`)

## Query analysis (C++ via GoogleSQL)

Goal: a syntactically-valid query produces a resolved AST and a plan, without
yet executing.

- ✅ `googlesql::Analyzer` plumbed through `Query.DryRun` and
  `Query.ExecuteQuery` (the DuckDB engine reuses the resolved AST
  from analysis as the input to the transpiler)
- ✅ Analysis errors surface via the BigQuery error envelope; the
  Go side maps engine gRPC status codes to BigQuery HTTP error
  shapes ([`gateway/handlers/queries.go`](./gateway/handlers/queries.go),
  [`gateway/handlers/errors.go`](./gateway/handlers/errors.go))
- ✅ `jobs.query?dryRun=true` works end-to-end (returns
  `totalBytesProcessed`, the analyzed schema, and any error with
  line + column info from the analyzer)
- ✅ Type/schema reflection: BigQuery `STANDARD_SQL` types <->
  GoogleSQL types via
  [`backend/schema/googlesql_to_bq.{h,cc}`](./backend/schema/)

## Query execution

Goal: run real queries through the local execution coordinator. The
gateway forwards analyzed queries to `emulator_main` over gRPC and
never branches on engine choice. Inside the engine, the route
classifier inspects the GoogleSQL `ResolvedAST` and dispatches to the
strategy that fits: DuckDB fast path (today's primary), DuckDB
rewrite / UDF, local semantic executor, or a catalog/control-op
handler.

- 🟡 [`backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/`](./backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/):
  the **DuckDB fast path**. A `googlesql::ResolvedASTVisitor` that
  emits DuckDB SQL strings, implemented one node kind at a time;
  per-shape route disposition (`duckdb_native` /
  `duckdb_rewrite` / `duckdb_udf` / `semantic_executor` /
  `control_op` / `unsupported`) lives in
  [`SHAPE_TRACKER.md`](./backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/SHAPE_TRACKER.md).
  Shapes routed to the other strategies are scheduled by the
  local-execution roadmap index linked at the top of this document
- ✅ Type lowering: BigQuery / GoogleSQL types -> DuckDB types
  (`INT64`, `FLOAT64`, `STRING`, `BYTES`, `BOOL`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`,
  `NUMERIC`, `BIGNUMERIC`, `JSON`, `INTERVAL`, `UUID`, `ARRAY<T>`,
  `STRUCT<...>`). `GEOGRAPHY` is `kSkiplist` until a GIS pass lands
- ✅ STRUCT handling: BQ struct literals + field access lower to
  DuckDB STRUCTs (`{'a': 1}`, `s."a"`); anonymous STRUCT fields
  synthesize positional names (`_0`, `_1`, ...) on both the
  construction and access sides so they round-trip; deep STRUCT
  mutations (`UPDATE t SET s.a.b = ...`) still fall back via the
  empty-string contract (see Open Questions)
- 🟡 UNNEST handling: standalone `UNNEST(arr) AS col` lowers to
  DuckDB `SELECT unnest(arr) AS "col"`. `WITH OFFSET`, multi-array
  zip, outer `UNNEST`, and lateral / cross-join shapes still surface
  `  UNIMPLEMENTED` pending the lateral / multi-array / WITH OFFSET
  shapes, which reroute from the DuckDB fast path to the local
  semantic executor via `array-struct-semantic-path.plan.md`
- 🟡 Built-in function mapping table — sourced from
  [`backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/functions.yaml`](./backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/functions.yaml)
  (~140 BigQuery functions across math, string, datetime,
  conditional, array, aggregation, window, and BQ-specific
  categories). A Bazel `genrule` materializes it into
  `functions_table.inc`, which `functions.cc` includes inside an
  `absl::flat_hash_map`. The current per-function disposition is
  `kMap` (emit a DuckDB function call — i.e. `duckdb_native` /
  `duckdb_rewrite`), `kFallback` (deferred lowering, surfaces
  UNIMPLEMENTED today; each entry has a planned route in either
  `duckdb-polyfill-udf-library.plan.md` or
  `semantic-functions-compliance.plan.md`), or `kSkiplist`
  (`unsupported` per `specialized-feature-policy.plan.md` —
  `APPROX_QUANTILES`, `ML.*`, `NET.*`, `KEYS.*`, `ST_*`, ...). The
  `execution-disposition-registry.plan.md` plan retires
  `kMap`/`kFallback`/`kSkiplist` in favor of the seven-route
  vocabulary used everywhere else. `SAFE.<fn>(...)` is handled
  uniformly regardless of disposition
- ✅ DuckDB fast-path execution: file-backed `catalog.duckdb`
  connection, the transpiled SQL is bound and executed via the DuckDB
  C++ client, DuckDB errors are translated back to the BigQuery error
  envelope. Routes that resolve to the semantic executor / control-op
  handlers will reuse the same connection for storage scans but bypass
  DuckDB's SQL engine for the BigQuery-semantics-sensitive evaluation
  step
- ✅ Result marshaling: DuckDB Arrow `RecordBatch` -> BigQuery REST
  row JSON (column-major Arrow walked into the row-major `f`/`v`
  shape; NULL bitmap honored; nested STRUCTs/ARRAYs recursed). The
  Storage Read API path reuses the Arrow batches directly without
  this conversion
- ✅ Job lifecycle: `pending` -> `running` -> `done`, statistics
  (`creationTime`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `totalBytesProcessed`)
  surfaced through [`gateway/jobs/`](./gateway/jobs/)

## Execution strategies

The router maps every `ResolvedAST` shape to one of seven route
dispositions; the same vocabulary lives in
[`backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/SHAPE_TRACKER.md`](./backend/engine/duckdb/transpiler/SHAPE_TRACKER.md)
on a per-node basis and in
[`docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md`](./docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md) as the
public-facing policy.

| Route                | What it is                                                                                  | Plan                                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `duckdb_native`      | Lowers directly to DuckDB SQL with semantics that already match BigQuery's exactly.         | `duckdb-fast-path-stabilization.plan.md`          |
| `duckdb_rewrite`     | Lowers to DuckDB SQL with a deliberate rewrite (e.g. struct/array shape rewrites, BigQuery JSON operators -> DuckDB JSON operators). | `duckdb-fast-path-stabilization.plan.md`          |
| `duckdb_udf`         | Adds a DuckDB UDF / macro to make the BigQuery function correct locally.                    | `duckdb-polyfill-udf-library.plan.md`             |
| `semantic_executor`  | Runs on a local row/value interpreter that owns exact BigQuery semantics; bypasses DuckDB SQL evaluation. | `semantic-executor-core.plan.md` + per-family plans |
| `control_op`         | DDL / metadata / catalog ops routed straight through the storage layer.                     | `control-op-executor.plan.md`                     |
| `local_stub`         | Specialized feature accepted at parse / analyzer but evaluated against a deterministic BigQuery-shaped placeholder (`KEYS.NEW_KEYSET`, `KEYS.KEYSET_LENGTH`, `CREATE MODEL`) so client-library startup probes succeed. | `specialized-feature-policy.plan.md`              |
| `unsupported`        | Deliberately out of scope locally. Surfaces a BigQuery-shaped `UNIMPLEMENTED` error naming the family + linking to `docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md`. | `specialized-feature-policy.plan.md`              |

- 🟡 Route classifier behind `Engine::Analyze` /
  `Engine::ExecuteQuery`
- 🟡 Per-shape dispositions recorded in the shape tracker
- 🟢 Route labels surfaced on conformance fixture output so
  passing rows can't hide accidental drift between strategies.
  Plan 16 (`conformance-routing-matrix.plan.md`) added the
  `emulatorRoute` debug field on `Job.statistics.query`
  (loopback-only, gated by `gateway/middleware/loopback.go`
  so only local-loopback callers see it), extended the
  conformance fixture schema with `expected.route` /
  `route_strict` / `route_allowlist`, backfilled every
  fixture under `conformance/fixtures/` (91/91), and added
  `task conformance:routing-matrix` for a reviewable
  Markdown snapshot of every shape's route. The
  `conformance.yml` CI workflow uploads the matrix as a
  non-blocking artifact.
- 🟡 CTE / subquery routing. Non-recursive CTEs
  (`ResolvedWithScan` / `ResolvedWithRefScan`) lower to DuckDB
  `WITH "a" AS (...)` natively. Non-correlated scalar / IN /
  EXISTS / ARRAY `ResolvedSubqueryExpr` forms lower directly to
  DuckDB. Correlated subqueries are promoted to the semantic
  executor at planning time (via
  `ResolvedSubqueryExpr::parameter_list()`) but the executor
  itself stays a structured `kNotImplemented` until the
  outer-row iteration primitive lands -- tracked under
  `cte-subquery-routing.plan.md`. Recursive CTEs and the LIKE
  ANY / ALL subquery family remain out of plan-10 scope and
  surface UNIMPLEMENTED; see `advanced-relational-routing.plan.md`

## DML / DDL

- 🟡 DML routed by shape. `MERGE` lowers through the DuckDB fast
  path today; `INSERT VALUES`, scalar-`SET` `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`
  now route through the storage-aware local DML executor
  (`backend/engine/semantic/dml/`) and populate
  `numDmlAffectedRows` correctly. `INSERT ... SELECT`,
  deep-STRUCT `SET` (`SET s.a.b = ...`), the harder MERGE matrix
  (`WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE`, multi-action sequences),
  `RETURNING`, and `ResolvedPipeInsertScan` continue to surface
  `UNIMPLEMENTED` and stay tracked under
  `dml-local-executor.plan.md`. Conformance fixtures may now seed
  rows via either `tabledata.insertAll` or `INSERT VALUES` `sql:`
  steps. See
  [`docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md`](./docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md) for the per-shape
  routing decisions.
- ✅ DDL routed to control ops. `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE AS
  SELECT`, `DROP TABLE`, and `ANALYZE` are wired today via a
  dedicated `ControlOpExecutor` that mutates `Storage` directly and
  emits a BigQuery-shaped envelope (`Job.statistics.query.statementType`
  populated per the BigQuery REST reference). The DuckDB SQL evaluator
  no longer carries any DDL paths — the route classifier dispatches
  every `control_op` statement root to `ControlOpExecutor`.
  `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` (full-refresh execution),
  `EXPORT DATA`, function registration, `ALTER TABLE` still surface
  `UNIMPLEMENTED` from the dedicated handlers; `ALTER TABLE` continues
  to lower through the DuckDB engine pending its own subagent. Tracked
  via `control-op-executor.plan.md` for the deferred handlers and
  `specialized-feature-policy.plan.md` for materialized-view refresh
  semantics
- 🟡 Scripting / UDFs / TVFs routed to a local scripting executor
  — `procedural-scripting-executor.plan.md` and
  `udf-tvf-module-routing.plan.md`. `ASSERT <expr> [AS '<msg>']`
  lands on the new `backend/engine/semantic/script/` package and
  surfaces BigQuery's documented `Assertion failed` envelope; the
  scripting variable environment has been generalized into the
  shared `semantic::FrameStack` primitive so the UDF / TVF call-
  side reuses the same stack-of-frames type. `ResolvedConstant`
  and `ResolvedArgumentRef` resolve on the semantic executor
  (case-insensitive identifier matching for arg refs). CALL /
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE / DECLARE / SET / BEGIN..END / IF / WHILE /
  LOOP / FOR / RAISE / EXCEPTION / CREATE PROCEDURE /
  `@@error.message` remain `status=planned` in
  `node_dispositions.yaml` until follow-up subagents pick them up;
  SQL UDF / TVF body storage + invocation + JS UDF
  registration-time rejection stay deferred until the per-engine
  UDF / TVF registry round-trip through `DuckDBStorage` lands
  (the prerequisite for cross-request function persistence)
- 🟡 Job stats: `numDmlAffectedRows` populated for INSERT VALUES,
  scalar-`SET` UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE (the families landed via
  `dml-local-executor.plan.md` Family 1-3 plus the existing DuckDB
  MERGE path). Deferred shapes (INSERT ... SELECT, deep-STRUCT
  UPDATE, MERGE harder branches, RETURNING, PipeInsertScan) keep
  the field absent until they land; the row count is otherwise
  the legacy aggregate (inserted + updated + deleted) per the
  BigQuery REST contract.

## Storage Read API (gRPC)

Goal: support BigQuery client libraries that prefer the Storage Read API
(`google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1`) for fast reads.

- 🟡 `BigQueryRead` gRPC service implemented
  ([`frontend/handlers/storage_read.{h,cc}`](./frontend/handlers/));
  `CreateReadSession` and `ReadRows` are wired, `SplitReadStream`
  is still pending (single-stream sessions only — see below)
- 🟡 Arrow output format implemented; Avro output is not wired yet
- ✅ **Native Arrow fast path.** DuckDB produces Arrow
  `RecordBatch`es as its native result format; `ReadRows` streams
  those batches straight onto the gRPC wire (`ArrowRecordBatch` /
  `ArrowSchema` messages) without round-tripping through the
  BigQuery REST `f`/`v` row shape, sidestepping the row-by-row
  serialization the REST path uses
- 🟡 `ReadOptions.row_restriction`: a single `<column> = <literal>`
  equality clause is pushed down into the DuckDB `read_parquet(...)`
  scan as a `WHERE` clause. Range / inequality ops, connectives,
  `IN`, `NULL`, and array/struct columns reject at `CreateReadSession`
  with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` (see "Supported `ReadOptions`" in
  [`docs/REST_API.md`](./docs/REST_API.md)). Multi-clause expansion
  is deferred to a follow-up subagent of
  [`storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md`](./.cursor/plans/storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md)
  because doing it half-right (parser-only, no analyzer-resolved
  boolean expression) is exactly the silent-approximation hazard
  the plan forbids
- ✅ `ReadOptions.selected_fields` enforced. CreateReadSession
  validates each name against the table's top-level columns
  (unknowns surface as `INVALID_ARGUMENT` before any streaming RPC
  starts) and the DuckDB backend emits a projected SELECT so the
  `ReadRows` stream yields rows in caller-pinned column order. The
  `ReadSession.schema` reply reflects the projection too
- ⏳ Single-stream sessions only — `max_stream_count > 1` is rejected.
  DuckDB's parallel scan + Arrow output makes multi-stream a
  tractable follow-up. Deferred to a follow-up subagent of
  [`storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md`](./.cursor/plans/storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md)
  pending a deterministic parquet-row-boundary partition design

## Storage Write API (gRPC)

Goal: support BigQuery client libraries that prefer the Storage
Write API (`google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.BigQueryWrite`) for
append-only writes that ride the same gRPC surface the read path
already uses.

- 🟡 `BigQueryWrite` gRPC service implemented
  ([`frontend/handlers/storage_write.{h,cc}`](./frontend/handlers/));
  `CreateWriteStream`, bidi-streaming `AppendRows`, and
  `GetWriteStream` are wired for the `COMMITTED` and reserved
  `_default` stream types. Append batches commit immediately
  through plan 9's `DuckDBStorage::AppendRows`, the same primitive
  the local DML executor uses
- 🟡 Schema-shape mismatches and recoverable storage errors land
  on the `AppendRowsResponse.error_message` envelope so a producer
  can fix the batch and retry without tearing the bidi stream down,
  matching the public Storage Write API's recoverable-error
  contract
- ⏳ `BUFFERED` and `PENDING` stream types not implemented;
  `CreateWriteStream` returns `UNIMPLEMENTED` for them.
  `FinalizeWriteStream` / `BatchCommitWriteStreams` / `FlushRows`
  reserve their proto slots but return `UNIMPLEMENTED` until the
  deferred follow-up subagent of
  [`storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md`](./.cursor/plans/storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md)
  lands the buffer / two-phase commit semantics. Silent
  approximation here is especially bad because `PENDING`'s
  transactional contract is exactly what distinguishes the Storage
  Write API from `tabledata.insertAll`

## Conformance harness

Goal: prove that real BigQuery client libraries work against the emulator.

The repo runs two independent conformance lanes; both are wired into
CI ([`.github/workflows/conformance.yml`](./.github/workflows/conformance.yml)
and
[`.github/workflows/thirdparty-samples.yml`](./.github/workflows/thirdparty-samples.yml)):

- ✅ **Fixture lane** — purpose-built YAML runner under
  [`conformance/`](./conformance/) (`task conformance:*`,
  `go run ./conformance/cmd/runner`). Seeds catalog state via REST,
  diffs `expected.rows` against the gateway's wire response with
  typed cell comparison (INT64 as `*big.Rat`, FLOAT64 with epsilon,
  RFC3339 / SQL-form timestamps, ...), supports `ordered` /
  `unordered` / `schema_only` matching modes. 18 fixtures today
  spanning SELECT shapes, GROUP BY / aggregates, JOINs, DDL,
  structural errors, and schema-only smokes. JSON output is
  consumed by the coverage publisher
- ✅ **Third-party client lane** — the five official BigQuery
  client-library sample suites are vendored under
  [`third_party/`](./third_party/) and driven by `task thirdparty:*`:
  Go (`cloud.google.com/go/bigquery`, including the Storage Read
  API), Node.js, Python (`google-cloud-bigquery`), Python
  (`bigframes`), and the Java `bigquery-samples` ITs (curated 15-IT
  Failsafe subset). Each suite reads
  `BIGQUERY_EMULATOR_HOST`/`BIGQUERY_STORAGE_GRPC_ENDPOINT` and
  optionally points at `fake-gcs-server` for GCS-backed subtests
- ✅ Per-suite skip rules pin which subtests today land on
  engine-side `UNIMPLEMENTED`s, so a CI regression is "a test that
  used to pass now fails" rather than "a test that never passed is
  still failing" — see `third_party/README.md` for the per-language
  skip matrices
- ⏳ Vendor a subset of the GoogleSQL `.test` corpus and run it
  against the engine via `jobs.query` (catches semantic
  regressions whenever GoogleSQL is upgraded). The GoogleSQL
  parity workflow ([`.github/workflows/googlesql-parity.yml`](./.github/workflows/googlesql-parity.yml))
  is the placeholder for this lane today

## Distribution

- ✅ `Dockerfile` that ships both binaries in one image
  (mirrors `gcr.io/cloud-spanner-emulator/emulator`)
- ✅ Docker Hub / GHCR publish workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`,
  pushes to `ghcr.io/vantaboard/bigquery-emulator`)
- ✅ Release-tagged static-ish Linux binaries via goreleaser
  (`bigquery-emulator-gateway`, bundled `bin/emulator_main` +
  `bin/libduckdb.so`; linux/amd64 engine only — see README §Releases)
- ✅ `--version` on both binaries reporting consistent semver +
  git commit + build date; gateway via `-X main.<sym>=…` ldflags
  (see `.goreleaser.yml`), engine via the `:version_cc` genrule under
  `binaries/emulator_main/BUILD.bazel`
- ✅ Runtime configuration documented in README §Runtime configuration;
  the conformance harness (`conformance/README.md`) and the engine
  policy (`docs/ENGINE_POLICY.md`) cover the local-only execution
  model and the per-route catalog. `emulator_main` accepts
  `--host_port` and `--data_dir` only; `--engine` / `--storage` /
  `--on_unknown_fn` were removed when the ReferenceImpl + in-memory
  backends were deleted, and the multi-strategy coordinator
  intentionally keeps that same single-knob posture (route selection
  happens internally at AST-classification time, not via a runtime
  flag).
- ✅ Install / launch flow documented in README §Quickstart,
  §Install via Docker, §Install via release archive, and
  §Pointing client libraries at the emulator (`docker run` +
  `BIGQUERY_EMULATOR_HOST` env-var override). Note: there is **no**
  `gcloud emulators bigquery start` subcommand — gcloud ships
  emulator subgroups only for Firestore and Spanner (plus
  pubsub / datastore / bigtable in alpha/beta), so the "gcloud
  install path" some users expect by analogy with Spanner does
  not exist for BigQuery and is not on the roadmap to add

---

## Non-goals

- No Go port of GoogleSQL. Engine is C++. If GoogleSQL changes, we rebuild;
  we do not chase semantics in Go.
- No fallback to the real BigQuery service. Everything runs locally,
  full stop — coverage and parity are responsibilities the
  multi-strategy coordinator owns inside this process. There is no
  cloud-passthrough mode and there is no plan to add one.
- Persistence is best-effort, not promised. The DuckDB-backed
  `--data_dir` is what runs in production; we don't claim durability
  semantics, replication, or backup.
- No production performance promises. We aren't competing with the
  real BigQuery service. Expect competitive numbers for the OLAP
  shapes that route through the DuckDB fast path; expect "fast
  enough for tests, not fast enough for benchmarks" for shapes that
  route through the semantic executor; expect `UNIMPLEMENTED` for
  shapes still on the `unsupported` route
  (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / scalar-only SELECT today, plus the
  unsupported-by-design families documented in
  `specialized-feature-policy.plan.md`).
- No BigQuery ML / BigQuery Omni / external data sources at first; opt-in
  later if there's demand, and only with a local implementation or a
  deterministic stub — never with a cloud passthrough.

## Build systems

The C++ engine is built with Bazel. The
`//binaries/emulator_main:emulator_main` `cc_binary` links
GoogleSQL's analyzer, the local execution coordinator (DuckDB fast
path today; the semantic executor / control-op executor / DuckDB UDF
polyfills link into the same binary as they land), the DuckDB storage
backend, the catalog / query / storage-read / storage-write gRPC
handlers, and grpc++ in one binary that serves `Query.DryRun`,
`Query.ExecuteQuery`, `bigquery_emulator.v1.StorageRead`, and
`bigquery_emulator.v1.StorageWrite` end-to-end.

GoogleSQL is consumed in one of two modes selected by
`GOOGLESQL_SOURCE` (defaults to `prebuilt`):

- `prebuilt` (default): the `@googlesql//...` Bazel external repo is
  hydrated from a published artifact under `.cache/googlesql-prebuilt/`
  so cold builds finish in a few minutes instead of the multi-hour
  link from source. Populate the cache with
  `task googlesql:fetch-prebuilt URL=<asset> SHA256=<hex>` or
  `task googlesql:stage-bazel`. There is no silent fallback if the
  cache is empty
- `local`: explicit source rebuild from a sibling `../googlesql/`
  checkout (`local_path_override` in
  [`MODULE.bazel`](./MODULE.bazel)). Used when iterating on a
  GoogleSQL upgrade or producer change

DuckDB v1.5.3 is pulled in as a prebuilt `libduckdb` tarball through
`http_archive` (see [`third_party/duckdb/`](./third_party/duckdb/)).
Build with `task emulator:build-engine:bazel` (alias
`task emulator:build-engine`) or directly
`bazel build //binaries/emulator_main:emulator_main`.

Linux/amd64 only today — the GoogleSQL hermetic LLVM toolchain ships
amd64 binaries and does not cross-build cleanly to linux/arm64 yet,
so the engine binary is not produced for arm64. Non-amd64 hosts
should use the published Docker image.

The integration tests under [`gateway/e2e/`](./gateway/e2e/)
discover the engine binary via `./bin/emulator_main`, and
`task emulator:build-engine:bazel` stages the Bazel-built binary +
sibling `libduckdb.so` there with an `rpath` of `$ORIGIN`.

## Open questions / things to investigate

- **Vendoring strategy for GoogleSQL.** Resolved — the engine consumes
  GoogleSQL from a published prebuilt artifact by default
  (`GOOGLESQL_SOURCE=prebuilt`) and falls back to a sibling source
  checkout when explicitly opted in. See "Build systems" above and
  [`docs/dev/googlesql-prebuilt/`](./docs/dev/googlesql-prebuilt/).
- **Subprocess vs. cgo.** Spanner uses subprocess + gRPC. Cleaner ABI, easier
  crash isolation, no cgo build complexity. We start there. Cgo could be
  revisited if subprocess overhead matters in CI runs.
- **Streaming inserts vs. Write API.** `tabledata.insertAll` is the
  REST-side append path; the Storage Write API
  (`google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.BigQueryWrite`) lands the
  `_default` + `COMMITTED` stream types on the same gRPC surface
  (`bigquery_emulator.v1.StorageWrite`) and routes appends through
  the same `DuckDBStorage::AppendRows` primitive the local DML
  executor owns. `BUFFERED` and `PENDING` (and the matching
  `FlushRows` / `FinalizeWriteStream` / `BatchCommitWriteStreams`
  RPCs) are deferred to a follow-up subagent of
  [`storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md`](./.cursor/plans/storage-read-write-api-plan.plan.md);
  they reserve their proto slots and return `UNIMPLEMENTED` today.
- **Dialect translation friction (GoogleSQL <-> DuckDB).** The DuckDB
  fast path is no longer the project's whole story, but the friction
  it surfaces is exactly why the local coordinator exists: shapes
  where DuckDB SQL diverges from BigQuery semantics get routed to a
  DuckDB rewrite, a DuckDB UDF, or the semantic executor instead of
  silently degrading. Known hazards we design routes around:
  - **`MERGE`.** GoogleSQL's `MERGE` permits `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`,
    and conditional branches on `WHEN MATCHED`, `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY
    SOURCE`, and `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET`. DuckDB's `INSERT ... ON
    CONFLICT` plus separate `UPDATE` / `DELETE` statements doesn't cover
    the full matrix. The easy shapes route `duckdb_native` /
    `duckdb_rewrite` today; the harder branches will route through the
    `dml-local-executor.plan.md` semantic path so we don't have to
    pretend DuckDB SQL can model them.
  - **Deep STRUCT mutations.** `UPDATE t SET s.a.b = ...` is well-defined
    in BigQuery but DuckDB's struct field updates are limited.
    Anything past a single-level rewrite routes through the
    `array-struct-semantic-path.plan.md` semantic executor so deep
    nested updates don't have to round-trip through JSON to fake
    field-existence semantics.
  - **Google-specific built-ins.** `APPROX_QUANTILES`, `HLL_COUNT.*`,
    `ML.*`, `BIT_COUNT`, `NET.*`, `KEYS.NEW_KEYSET`, GIS / GEOGRAPHY
    functions, and date-arithmetic edge cases (`DATE_ADD(d, INTERVAL 1
    MONTH)` semantics on month-end) often have no DuckDB analog. The
    function-disposition table now records a routing disposition per
    entry; close-enough functions become `duckdb_udf`, BigQuery-exact
    ones become `semantic_executor`, and entire families
    (`specialized-feature-policy.plan.md`) declare a policy of "local
    implementation now," "deterministic stub with BigQuery-shaped
    error," or "unsupported by design."
  - **NULL-equality, ordering, and float corner cases** between the two
    engines are subtly different (e.g., NaN ordering, `IS NULL` in joins,
    integer overflow behavior). Shapes that depend on these route to
    the semantic executor (`semantic-functions-compliance.plan.md`)
    rather than being approximated in DuckDB SQL.
  - **JSON.** BigQuery's `JSON` type and `JSON_VALUE` / `JSON_QUERY`
    functions are mostly portable. The common cases route
    `duckdb_native` / `duckdb_rewrite` today; the precisely-typed
    edges (`JSON` vs. `STRING`-encoded JSON, exact path-navigator
    semantics) become `duckdb_udf` or `semantic_executor` as their
    semantic gaps surface.
  - The pragmatic answer to all of the above is the route catalog,
    not "everything becomes a transpiler shape." Unmapped shapes return
    `UNIMPLEMENTED` rather than silently degrading, but the router has
    five places to put a shape before that and the plan set names which
    one each remaining unsupported shape is going to land in.
