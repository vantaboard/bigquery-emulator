GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports the following format elements.

## Format elements for date and time parts

Many GoogleSQL parsing and formatting functions rely on a format string
to describe the format of parsed or formatted values. A format string represents
the textual form of date and time and contains separate format elements that are
applied left-to-right.

These functions use format strings:

- [`FORMAT_DATE`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#format_date)
- [`FORMAT_DATETIME`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/datetime_functions#format_datetime)
- [`FORMAT_TIME`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/time_functions#format_time)
- [`FORMAT_TIMESTAMP`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#format_timestamp)
- [`PARSE_DATE`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#parse_date)
- [`PARSE_DATETIME`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/datetime_functions#parse_datetime)
- [`PARSE_TIME`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/time_functions#parse_time)
- [`PARSE_TIMESTAMP`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#parse_timestamp)

## Format clause for CAST

    format_clause:
      FORMAT format_model

    format_model:
      format_string_expression

The format clause can be used in some [`CAST` functions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_functions#cast). You
use a format clause to provide instructions for how to conduct a
cast. For example, you could
instruct a cast to convert a sequence of bytes to a base64-encoded string
instead of a UTF-8-encoded string.

The format clause includes a format model. The format model can contain
format elements combined together as a format string.

### Format bytes as string

    CAST(bytes_expression AS STRING FORMAT format_string_expression)

You can cast a sequence of bytes to a string with a format element in the
format string. If the bytes can't be formatted with a
format element, an error is returned. If the sequence of bytes is `NULL`, the
result is `NULL`. Format elements are case-insensitive.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| HEX | Converts a sequence of bytes into a hexadecimal string. | Input: b'\\x00\\x01\\xEF\\xFF' Output: 0001efff |
| BASEX | Converts a sequence of bytes into a [BASEX](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#about_basex_encoding) encoded string. X represents one of these numbers: 2, 8, 16, 32, 64. | Input as BASE8: b'\\x02\\x11\\x3B' Output: 00410473 |
| BASE64M | Converts a sequence of bytes into a [base64](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#about_basex_encoding)-encoded string based on [rfc 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8) for MIME. Generates a newline character ("\\n") every 76 characters. | Input: b'\\xde\\xad\\xbe\\xef' Output: 3q2+7w== |
| ASCII | Converts a sequence of bytes that are ASCII values to a string. If the input contains bytes that aren't a valid ASCII encoding, an error is returned. | Input: b'\\x48\\x65\\x6c\\x6c\\x6f' Output: Hello |
| UTF-8 | Converts a sequence of bytes that are UTF-8 values to a string. If the input contains bytes that aren't a valid UTF-8 encoding, an error is returned. | Input: b'\\x24' Output: $ |
| UTF8 | Same behavior as UTF-8. |   |

**Return type**

`STRING`

**Example**

    SELECT CAST(b'\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f' AS STRING FORMAT 'ASCII') AS bytes_to_string;

    /*---+
     | bytes_to_string |
     +---+
     | Hello           |
     +---*/

### Format string as bytes

    CAST(string_expression AS BYTES FORMAT format_string_expression)

You can cast a string to bytes with a format element in the
format string. If the string can't be formatted with the
format element, an error is returned. Format elements are case-insensitive.

In the string expression, whitespace characters, such as `\n`, are ignored
if the `BASE64` or `BASE64M` format element is used.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The bytes output value is displayed as a base64-encoded string. For example, `b'\x00\x01\xEF\xFF'` is displayed as `0001efff` when you use the `HEX` format element.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| HEX | Converts a hexadecimal-encoded string to bytes. If the input contains characters that aren't part of the HEX encoding alphabet (0\~9, case-insensitive a\~f), an error is returned. | Input: '0001efff' Output: b'\\x00\\x01\\xEF\\xFF' |
| BASEX | Converts a [BASEX](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#about_basex_encoding)-encoded string to bytes. X represents one of these numbers: 2, 8, 16, 32, 64. An error is returned if the input contains characters that aren't part of the BASEX encoding alphabet, except whitespace characters if the format element is `BASE64`. | Input as BASE8: '00410473' Output: b'\\x02\\x11\\x3B' |
| BASE64M | Converts a [base64](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#about_basex_encoding)-encoded string to bytes. If the input contains characters that aren't whitespace and not part of the base64 encoding alphabet defined at [rfc 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8), an error is returned. `BASE64M` and `BASE64` decoding have the same behavior. | Input: '3q2+7w==' Output: b'\\xde\\xad\\xbe\\xef' |
| ASCII | Converts a string with only ASCII characters to bytes. If the input contains characters that aren't ASCII characters, an error is returned. | Input: 'Hello' Output: b'\\x48\\x65\\x6c\\x6c\\x6f' |
| UTF-8 | Converts a string to a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. | Input: '$' Output: b'\\x24' |
| UTF8 | Same behavior as UTF-8. |   |

**Return type**

`BYTES`

**Example**

    SELECT CAST('Hello' AS BYTES FORMAT 'ASCII') AS string_to_bytes

    -- Displays the bytes output value (b'\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f').

    /*---+
     | string_to_bytes         |
     +---+
     | b'\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f' |
     +---*/

### Format date and time as string

You can format these date and time parts as a string:

- [Format year part as string](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_year_as_string)
- [Format month part as string](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_month_as_string)
- [Format day part as string](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_day_as_string)
- [Format hour part as string](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_hour_as_string)
- [Format minute part as string](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_minute_as_string)

- [Format literal as string](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_literal_as_string)

Case matching is supported when you format some date or time parts as a string
and the output contains letters. To learn more,
see [Case matching](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#case_matching_date_time).

#### Case matching

When the output of some format element contains letters, the letter cases of
the output is matched with the letter cases of the format element,
meaning the words in the output are capitalized according to how the
format element is capitalized. This is called case matching. The rules are:

- If the first two letters of the element are both upper case, the words in the output are capitalized. For example `DAY` = `THURSDAY`.
- If the first letter of the element is upper case, and the second letter is lowercase, the first letter of each word in the output is capitalized and other letters are lowercase. For example `Day` = `Thursday`.
- If the first letter of the element is lowercase, then all letters in the output are lowercase. For example, `day` = `thursday`.

#### Format year part as string

    CAST(expression AS STRING FORMAT format_string_expression)

Casts a data type that contains the year part to a string. Includes
format elements, which provide instructions for how to conduct the cast.

- [Format string as literal part](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_string_as_literal)

When formatting a string with date and time parts, you must follow the
[format model rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_model_rules_date_time).

#### Format model rules

When casting a string to date and time parts, you must ensure the *format model*
is valid. The format model represents the elements passed into
`CAST(string_expression AS type FORMAT format_string_expression)` as the
`format_string_expression` and is validated according to the following
rules:

- It contains at most one of each of the following parts: meridian indicator, year, month, day, hour.
- A non-literal, non-whitespace format element can't appear more than once.
- If it contains the day of year format element, `DDD`, then it can't contain the month.
- If it contains the 24-hour format element, `HH24`, then it can't contain the 12-hour format element or a meridian indicator.
- If it contains the 12-hour format element, `HH12` or `HH`, then it must also contain a meridian indicator.
- If it contains a meridian indicator, then it must also contain a 12-hour format element.
- If it contains the second of the day format element, `SSSSS`, then it can't contain any of the following: hour, minute, second, or meridian indicator.
- It can't contain a format element such that the value it sets doesn't exist in the target type. For example, an hour format element such as `HH24` can't appear in a string you are casting as a `DATE`.

#### Format string as year part

    CAST(string_expression AS type FORMAT format_string_expression)

Casts a string-formatted year to a data type that contains
the year part. Includes format elements, which provide instructions for how
to conduct the cast.

- `string_expression`: This expression contains the string with the year that you need to format.
- `type`: The data type to which you are casting. Must include the year part.
- `format_string_expression`: A string which contains format elements, including the year format element. The formats elements in this string are defined collectively as the format model, which must follow [these rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_model_rules_date_time).

These data types include a year part:

- `DATE`
- `DATETIME`
- `TIMESTAMP`

If the `YEAR` part is missing from `string_expression` and the return type
includes this part, `YEAR` is set to the current year.

An error is generated if a value that isn't a supported format element appears
in `format_string_expression` or `string_expression` doesn't contain a value
specified by a format element.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| YYYY | If it's delimited, matches 1 to 5 digits. If it isn't delimited, matches 4 digits.

| Y | Matches 1 digit. Sets the last digit of the year part to the matched number. | Input for Y-MM-DD: '8-12-03' Output as DATE: 2008-12-03 |
| Y,YYY | Matches the pattern of 1 to 2 digits, comma, then exactly 3 digits. Sets the year part to the matched number. | Input for Y,YYY-MM-DD: '2,018-12-03' Output as DATE: 2008-12-03 |
| RRRR | Same behavior as YYYY. |   |
| RR | Matches 2 digits. If the 2 digits entered are between 00 and 49 and the last 2 digits of the current year are between 00 and 49, the returned year has the same first 2 digits as the current year. If the last 2 digits of the current year are between 50 and 99, the first 2 digits of the returned year is 1 greater than the first 2 digits of the current year. If the 2 digits entered are between 50 and 99 and the last 2 digits of the current year are between 00 and 49, the first 2 digits of the returned year are 1 less than the first 2 digits of the current year. If the last 2 digits of the current year are between 50 and 99, the returned year has the same first 2 digits as the current year. | Input for RR-MM-DD: '18-12-03' Output as DATE: 2018-12-03 (executed in the year 2021) Output as DATE: 2118-12-03 (executed in the year 2050) *** ** * ** *** Input for RR-MM-DD: '50-12-03' Output as DATE: 2050-12-03 (executed in the year 2021) Output as DATE: 2050-12-03 (executed in the year 2050) |

#### Format string as meridian indicator part

    CAST(string_expression AS type FORMAT format_string_expression)

Casts a string-formatted meridian indicator to a data type that contains
the meridian indicator part. Includes format elements, which provide instructions for how
to conduct the cast.

- `string_expression`: This expression contains the string with the meridian indicator that you need to format.
- `type`: The data type to which you are casting. Must include the meridian indicator part.
- `format_string_expression`: A string which contains format elements, including the meridian indicator format element. The formats elements in this string are defined collectively as the format model, which must follow [these rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_model_rules_date_time).

These data types include a meridian indicator part:

- `TIME`
- `DATETIME`
- `TIMESTAMP`

An error is generated if a value that isn't a supported format element appears
in `format_string_expression` or `string_expression` doesn't contain a value
specified by a format element.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| A.M. or P.M. | Matches using the regular expression `'(A|P)\.M\.'`. | Input for HH:MI A.M.: '03:30 A.M.' Output as TIME: 03:30:00 *** ** * ** *** Input for HH:MI P.M.: '03:30 P.M.' Output as TIME: 15:30:00 *** ** * ** *** Input for HH:MI P.M.: '03:30 A.M.' Output as TIME: 03:30:00 *** ** * ** *** Input for HH:MI A.M.: '03:30 P.M.' Output as TIME: 15:30:00 *** ** * ** *** Input for HH:MI a.m.: '03:30 a.m.' Output as TIME: 03:30:00 |

**Return type**

The data type to which the string was cast. This can be:

- `TIME`
- `DATETIME`
- `TIMESTAMP`

**Examples**

    SELECT CAST('03:30 P.M.' AS TIME FORMAT 'HH:MI A.M.') AS string_to_date_time

#### Format string as time zone part

    CAST(string_expression AS type FORMAT format_string_expression)

Casts a string-formatted time zone to a data type that contains
the time zone part. Includes format elements, which provide instructions for how
to conduct the cast.

- `string_expression`: This expression contains the string with the time zone that you need to format.
- `type`: The data type to which you are casting. Must include the time zone part.
- `format_string_expression`: A string which contains format elements, including the time zone format element. The formats elements in this string are defined collectively as the format model, which must follow [these rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_model_rules_date_time).

These data types include a time zone part:

- `DATE`
- `TIME`
- `DATETIME`
- `TIMESTAMP`

An error is generated if a value that isn't a supported format element appears
in `format_string_expression` or `string_expression` doesn't contain a value
specified by a format element.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| TZH | Matches using the regular expression `'(\+|\-| )[0-9]{2}'`. Sets the time zone and hour parts to the matched sign and number. Sets the time zone sign to be the first letter of the matched string. The number 2 means matching up to 2 digits for non-exact matching, and exactly 2 digits for exact matching. | Input for YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSTZH: '2008-12-25 05:30:00-08' Output as TIMESTAMP: 2008-12-25 05:30:00-08 |
| TZM | Matches 2 digits. Let `n` be the matched number. If the time zone sign is the minus sign, sets the time zone minute part to `-n`. Otherwise, sets the time zone minute part to `n`. | Input for YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSTZH: '2008-12-25 05:30:00+05.30' Output as TIMESTAMP: 2008-12-25 05:30:00+05.30 |

**Return type**

The data type to which the string was cast. This can be:

- `DATE`

| Whitespace | A consecutive sequence of one or more spaces in the format model is matched with one or more consecutive Unicode whitespace characters in the input. Space means the ASCII 32 space character. It doesn't mean the general whitespace such as a tab or new line. Any whitespace character that isn't the ASCII 32 character in the format model generates an error. |   |
| "text" | Output generated by the format element in formatting, using this regular expression, with `s` representing the string input: `regex.escape(s)`. | Input: "abc" Output: abc *** ** * ** *** Input: "a\\"b\\\\c" Output: a"b\\c |

### Format numeric type as string

    CAST(numeric_expression AS STRING FORMAT format_string_expression)

You can cast a [numeric type](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#numeric_types) to a string by combining the
following format elements:

- [Digits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_digits)
- [Decimal point](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_decimal_point)
- [Sign](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_sign)
- [Currency symbol](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_currency_symbol)
- [Group separator](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_group_separator)
- [Other format elements](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_other_elements)

Except for the exponent format element (`EEEE`), all of the format elements
generate a fixed number of characters in the output, and the output is aligned
by the decimal point. The first character outputs a `-` for negative numbers;
otherwise a space. To suppress blank characters and trailing zeroes, use the
`FM` flag.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Some format elements are locale-specific. GoogleSQL always uses the `'en-us'` locale.

**Return type**

`STRING`

**Example**

    SELECT input, CAST(input AS STRING FORMAT '$999,999.999') AS output
    FROM UNNEST([1.2, 12.3, 123.456, 1234.56, -12345.678, 1234567.89]) AS input

    /*---+---+

     |    1234.56 |    $1,234.560 |
     | -12345.678 |  -$12,345.678 |
     | 1234567.89 |  $###,###.### |
     +---+---*/

#### Format digits as string

The following format elements output digits. If there aren't enough
digit format elements to represent the input, all digit format elements are
replaced with `#` in the output.
If there are no sign format elements, one extra space is reserved for the sign.
For example, if the input is `12` and the format string is
`'99'`, then the output is `' 12'`, with a length of three
characters.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | A decimal digit. Leading and trailing zeros are included. | Input: `12` Format: `'000'` Output: `' 012'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `12` Format: `'000.000'` Output: `' 012.000'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `-12` Format: `'000.000'` Output: `'-012.000'` |
| 9 | A decimal digit. Leading zeros are replaced with spaces. Trailing zeros are included. | Input: `12` Format: `'999'` Output: `' 12'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `12` Format: `'999.999'` Output: `' 12.000'` |
| X or x | A hexadecimal digit. Can't appear with other format elements except 0, FM, and the sign format elements. The maximum number of hexadecimal digits in the format string is 16. X generates uppercase letters and x generates lowercase letters. When 0 is combined with the hexadecimal format element, the letter generated by 0 matches the case of the next X or x element. If there is no subsequent X or x, then 0 generates an uppercase letter. | Input: `43981` Format: `'XXXX'` Output: `' ABCD'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `43981` Format: `'xxxx'` Output: `' abcd'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `43981` Format: `'0X0x'` Output: `' ABcd'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `43981` Format: `'0000000X'` Output: `' 0000ABCD'` |

**Return type**

`STRING`

**Example**

    SELECT
      CAST(12 AS STRING FORMAT '999') as a,
      CAST(-12 AS STRING FORMAT '999') as b;

    /*---+---+
     | a    | b    |
     +---+---+
     |   12 |  -12 |
     +---+---*/

#### Format decimal point as string

The following format elements output a decimal point. These format elements are
mutually exclusive. At most one can appear in the format string.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| . (period) | Decimal point. | Input: `123.58` Format: `'999.999'` Output: `' 123.580'` |

    /*---+
     | a      |
     +---+
     |  12.50 |
     +---*/

#### Format sign as string

The following format elements output the sign (+/-). These format elements are
mutually exclusive. At most one can appear in the format string.

If there are no sign format elements, one extra space is reserved for the sign.
For example, if the input is `12` and the format string is
`'99'`, then the output is `' 12'`, with a length of three
characters.

The sign appears before the number. If the format model includes a currency
symbol element, then the sign appears before the currency symbol.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| S | Explicit sign. Outputs `+` for positive numbers and `-` for negative numbers. The position in the output is anchored to the number. `NaN` and `0` will not be signed. | Input: `-12` Format: `'S9999'` Output: `' -12'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `-12` Format: `'9999S'` Output: `' 12-'` |

| PR | For negative numbers, the value is enclosed in angle brackets. For positive numbers, the value is returned with a leading and trailing space. This element can only appear in the last position. | Input: `12` Format: `'9999PR'` Output: `' 12 '` *** ** * ** *** Input: `-12` Format: `'9999PR'` Output: `' <12>'` |

**Return type**

`STRING`

**Example**

    SELECT
      CAST(12 AS STRING FORMAT 'S99') as a,
      CAST(-12 AS STRING FORMAT 'S99') as b;

    /*---+---+
     | a   | b   |
     +---+---+
     | +12 | -12 |
     +---+---*/

#### Format currency symbol as string

The following format elements output a currency symbol. These format elements
are mutually exclusive. At most one can appear in the format string. In the
output, the currency symbol appears before the first digit or decimal point.

| Format element | Returns | Example |
|---|---|---|
| $ | Dollar sign ($). | Input: `-12` Format: `'$999'` Output: `' -$12'` |
| C or c | The ISO-4217 currency code of the current locale. | Input: `-12` Format: `'C999'` Output: `' -USD12'` *** ** * ** *** Input: `-12` Format: `'c999'` Output: `' -usd12'` |

### About BASE encoding

BASE encoding translates binary data in string format into a radix-X
representation.

If X is 2, 8, or 16, Arabic numerals 0--9 and the Latin letters
a--z are used in the encoded string. So for example, BASE16/Hexadecimal encoding
results contain 0\~9 and a\~f.

If X is 32 or 64, the default character tables are defined in
[rfc 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-3.3). When you decode a BASE string where X is 2, 8, or 16,
the Latin letters in the input string are case-insensitive. For example, both
"3a" and "3A" are valid input strings for BASE16/Hexadecimal decoding, and
will output the same result.
