    AGG(measure_expression)

**Description**

Aggregates a [measure type](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#measure_type). A measure type encapsulates an
aggregate calculation to perform, locked to a specific granularity defined by
a key. The `AGG` function invokes the calculation exactly once per key
with the guarantee of avoiding overcounting. Measures are useful for defining
business metrics. You can perform aggregation using the `AGG`
function instead of complex aggregation queries.

For more information and examples of using the `AGG` function
with measures, see [work with measures](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/graph-measures).

**Supported Argument Types**

A single `MEASURE` type

**Returned Data Types**

The type returned by the expression associated with the measure.

**Examples**

The following example creates a graph called `StoreGraph` based on the
`Stores` and `Locations` tables. The node table defined by location data has
a measure property called `total_population`. The measure is defined by the
aggregate calculation `SUM(population)` and the key `id`.

    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.Stores (
      name STRING PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
      location_id INT64 REFERENCES mydataset.Locations(id) NOT ENFORCED
    ) AS (
      SELECT 'Store 1' AS name, 101 AS location_id
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'Store 2' AS name, 101 AS location_id
    );

    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.Locations (
      id INT64 PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
      name STRING,
      population INT64
    ) AS (
      SELECT 101 AS id, 'Anytown' AS name, 1000 AS population
    );

    CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH mydataset.StoreGraph
      NODE TABLES (
        mydataset.Stores AS S,
        mydataset.Locations AS L
        PROPERTIES(id, name, population, MEASURE(SUM(population)) AS total_population)
      )
      EDGE TABLES (
        mydataset.Stores AS SL
        SOURCE KEY (location_id) REFERENCES L (id)
        DESTINATION KEY (name) REFERENCES S (name)
      );

To access measures defined on a graph, you must call the
[`GRAPH_EXPAND` TVF](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/graph-sql-queries#graph_expand), which performs a series of `LEFT JOIN`
operations on your graph's input tables to produce a flattened version of
the graph.

The following query calls the `GRAPH_EXPAND` function and omits the
`L_total_population` column from the output because
you can't directly select a column for a property defined by a measure without
using the `AGG` function:

    SELECT * EXCEPT(L_total_population)
    FROM GRAPH_EXPAND('mydataset.StoreGraph');

    /*---+---+---+---+---+
     | S_location_id | S_name  | L_id | L_name  | L_population |
     +---+---+---+---+---+
     | 101           | Store 2 | 101  | Anytown | 1000         |
     | 101           | Store 1 | 101  | Anytown | 1000         |
     +---+---+---+---+---*/

The following query shows the difference between aggregating a measure and
a regular value. When you apply the `AGG` function to the `L_total_population`
measure, the population of a location is counted exactly once per distinct
`location_id` value.
If you call the `SUM` function on `L_population`, then the `L_population`
column contributes the population for every row in the table with a given
location ID.

    SELECT
      S_location_id,
      AGG(L_total_population) AS true_total_population,
      SUM(L_population) AS overcounted_population
    FROM GRAPH_EXPAND('mydataset.StoreGraph')
    GROUP BY S_location_id;

    /*---+---+---+
     | S_location_id | true_total_population | overcounted_population |
     +---+---+---+
     | 101           | 1000                  | 2000                   |
     +---+---+---*/

## `ANY_VALUE`

    ANY_VALUE(
      expression
      [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } having_expression ]
    )
    [ OVER over_clause ]

    over_clause:
      { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

    window_specification:
      [ named_window ]
      [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
      [ window_frame_clause ]

**Description**

Returns `expression` for some row chosen from the group. Which row is chosen is
nondeterministic, not random. Returns `NULL` when the input produces no
rows. Returns `NULL` when `expression`
or `having_expression` is
`NULL` for all rows in the group.

If `expression` contains any non-NULL values, then `ANY_VALUE` behaves as if
`IGNORE NULLS` is specified;
rows for which `expression` is `NULL` aren't considered and won't be
selected.

If the `HAVING` clause is included in the `ANY_VALUE` function, the
`OVER` clause can't be used with this function.

To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
[Aggregate function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls).

To learn more about the `OVER` clause and how to use it, see
[Window function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls).

## `AVG`

    AVG(
      [ DISTINCT ]
      expression
    )
    [ OVER over_clause ]

    over_clause:
      { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

    window_specification:
      [ named_window ]
      [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
      [ window_frame_clause ]

**Description**

Returns the average of non-`NULL` values in an aggregated group.

To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
[Aggregate function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls).

This function can be used with the
[`AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD` clause](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#agg_threshold_clause).

If this function is used with the `OVER` clause, it's part of a
window function call. In a window function call,
aggregate function clauses can't be used.
To learn more about the `OVER` clause and how to use it, see
[Window function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls).

`AVG` can be used with differential privacy. For more information, see
[Differentially private aggregate functions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-dp-functions).

Caveats:

- If the aggregated group is empty or the argument is `NULL` for all rows in the group, returns `NULL`.
- If the argument is `NaN` for any row in the group, returns `NaN`.
- If the argument is `[+|-]Infinity` for any row in the group, returns either `[+|-]Infinity` or `NaN`.
- If there is numeric overflow, produces an error.
- If a [floating-point type](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#floating_point_types) is returned, the result is [non-deterministic](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#floating_point_semantics), which means you might receive a different result each time you use this function.

    COUNT(
      [ DISTINCT ]
      expression
    )
    [ OVER over_clause ]

      [ named_window ]
      [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
      [ window_frame_clause ]

**Description**

Gets the number of rows in the input or the number of rows with an
expression evaluated to any value other than `NULL`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If you're querying a large dataset, you can compute results faster and save resources by using [HLL++ functions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hll_functions) for approximate distinct counts. For more information, see [Sketches](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sketches).

**Definitions**

- `*`: Use this value to get the number of all rows in the input.
- `expression`: A value of any data type that represents the expression to evaluate. If `DISTINCT` is present, `expression` can only be a data type that is [groupable](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#groupable_data_types).
- Optional aggregate clauses: To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass into this function, see [Aggregate function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls).

<!-- -->

- `OVER`: To learn more about the `OVER` clause and how to use it, see [Window function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls).

**Details**

To count the number of distinct values of an expression for which a
certain condition is satisfied, you can use the following recipe:

    COUNT(DISTINCT IF(condition, expression, NULL))

`IF` returns the value of `expression` if `condition` is `TRUE`, or
`NULL` otherwise. The surrounding `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` ignores the `NULL`
values, so it counts only the distinct values of `expression` for which
`condition` is `TRUE`.

To count the number of non-distinct values of an expression for which a
certain condition is satisfied, consider using the
[`COUNTIF`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#countif) function.

This function with `DISTINCT` supports specifying [collation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/collation-concepts).

`COUNT` can be used with differential privacy. For more information, see
[Differentially private aggregate functions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-dp-functions).

**Return type**

`INT64`

**Examples**

You can use the `COUNT` function to return the number of rows in a table or the
number of distinct values of an expression. For example:

    SELECT
      COUNT(*) AS count_star,
      COUNT(DISTINCT x) AS count_dist_x
    FROM UNNEST([1, 4, 4, 5]) AS x;

    /*---+---+
     | count_star | count_dist_x |
     +---+---+
     | 4          | 3            |
     +---+---*/

    SELECT
      x,
      COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY MOD(x, 3)) AS count_star,
      COUNT(DISTINCT x) OVER (PARTITION BY MOD(x, 3)) AS count_dist_x
    FROM UNNEST([1, 4, 4, 5]) AS x;

    /*---+---+---+
     | x    | count_star | count_dist_x |

     | 5    | 1          | 1            |
     +---+---+---*/

    SELECT
      x,
      COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY MOD(x, 3)) AS count_star,
      COUNT(x) OVER (PARTITION BY MOD(x, 3)) AS count_x
    FROM UNNEST([1, 4, NULL, 4, 5]) AS x;

    /*---+---+---+
     | x    | count_star | count_x |
     +---+---+---+
     | NULL | 1          | 0       |
     | 1    | 3          | 3       |
     | 4    | 3          | 3       |

     | 5    | 1          | 1       |
     +---+---+---*/

The following query counts the number of distinct positive values of `x`:

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT IF(x > 0, x, NULL)) AS distinct_positive
    FROM UNNEST([1, -2, 4, 1, -5, 4, 1, 3, -6, 1]) AS x;

    /*---+
     | distinct_positive |
     +---+
     | 3                 |
     +---*/

The following query counts the number of distinct dates on which a certain kind
of event occurred:

    WITH Events AS (
      SELECT DATE '2021-01-01' AS event_date, 'SUCCESS' AS event_type
      UNION ALL
      SELECT DATE '2021-01-02' AS event_date, 'SUCCESS' AS event_type
      UNION ALL
      SELECT DATE '2021-01-02' AS event_date, 'FAILURE' AS event_type

      UNION ALL
      SELECT DATE '2021-01-04' AS event_date, 'FAILURE' AS event_type
    )
    SELECT
      COUNT(DISTINCT IF(event_type = 'FAILURE', event_date, NULL))
        AS distinct_dates_with_failures
    FROM Events;

    /*---+
     | distinct_dates_with_failures |
     +---+
     | 2                            |
     +---*/

The following query counts the number of distinct `id`s that exist in both
the `customers` and `vendor` tables:

    WITH
      customers AS (
        SELECT 1934 AS id, 'a' AS team UNION ALL
        SELECT 2991, 'b' UNION ALL
        SELECT 3988, 'c'),
      vendors AS (
        SELECT 1934 AS id, 'd' AS team UNION ALL
        SELECT 2991, 'e' UNION ALL
        SELECT 4366, 'f')
    SELECT

    [ OVER over_clause ]

    over_clause:
      { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

    window_specification:
      [ named_window ]
      [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
      [ window_frame_clause ]

**Description**

Gets the number of `TRUE` values for an expression.

**Definitions**

- `expression`: A `BOOL` value that represents the expression to evaluate.
- Optional aggregate clauses: To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass into this function, see [Aggregate function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls).

<!-- -->

- `OVER`: To learn more about the `OVER` clause and how to use it, see [Window function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls).

**Details**

The function signature `COUNTIF(DISTINCT ...)` is generally not useful. If you
would like to use `DISTINCT`, use `COUNT` with `DISTINCT IF`. For more
information, see the [`COUNT`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#count) function.

**Return type**

`INT64`

**Examples**

    SELECT COUNTIF(x<0) AS num_negative, COUNTIF(x>0) AS num_positive
    FROM UNNEST([5, -2, 3, 6, -10, -7, 4, 0]) AS x;

     +---+---*/

## `GROUPING`

    GROUPING(groupable_value)

**Description**

If a groupable item in the [`GROUP BY` clause](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#group_by_clause) is aggregated
(and thus not grouped), this function returns `1`. Otherwise,
this function returns `0`.

Definitions:

- `groupable_value`: An expression that represents a value that can be grouped in the `GROUP BY` clause.

Details:

The `GROUPING` function is helpful if you need to determine which rows are
produced by which grouping sets. A grouping set is a group of columns by which
rows can be grouped together. So, if you need to filter rows by
a few specific grouping sets, you can use the `GROUPING` function to identify
which grouping sets grouped which rows by creating a matrix of the results.

In addition, you can use the `GROUPING` function to determine the type of
`NULL` produced by the `GROUP BY` clause. In some cases, the `GROUP BY` clause
produces a `NULL` placeholder. This placeholder represents all groupable items
that are aggregated (not grouped) in the current grouping set. This is different
from a standard `NULL`, which can also be produced by a query.

For more information, see the following examples.

**Returned Data Type**

`INT64`

**Examples**

In the following example, it's difficult to determine which rows are grouped by
the grouping value `product_type` or `product_name`. The `GROUPING` function
makes this easier to determine.

Pay close attention to what's in the `product_type_agg` and
`product_name_agg` column matrix. This determines how the rows are grouped.

| `product_type_agg` | `product_name_agg` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | Rows are grouped by `product_name`. |
| 0 | 1 | Rows are grouped by `product_type`. |
| 0 | 0 | Rows are grouped by `product_type` and `product_name`. |
| 1 | 1 | Grand total row. |

    WITH
      Products AS (
        SELECT 'shirt' AS product_type, 't-shirt' AS product_name, 3 AS product_count UNION ALL
        SELECT 'shirt', 't-shirt', 8 UNION ALL
        SELECT 'shirt', 'polo', 25 UNION ALL
        SELECT 'pants', 'jeans', 6
      )
    SELECT
      product_type,
      product_name,
      SUM(product_count) AS product_sum,
      GROUPING(product_type) AS product_type_agg,
      GROUPING(product_name) AS product_name_agg,
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(product_type, product_name, ())
    ORDER BY product_name;

    /*---+---+---+---+---+

     +---+---+---+---+---*/

In the following example, it's difficult to determine
if `NULL` represents a `NULL` placeholder or a standard `NULL` value in the
`product_type` column. The `GROUPING` function makes it easier to
determine what type of `NULL` is being produced. If
`product_type_is_aggregated` is `1`, the `NULL` value for
the `product_type` column is a `NULL` placeholder.

    WITH
      Products AS (
        SELECT 'shirt' AS product_type, 't-shirt' AS product_name, 3 AS product_count UNION ALL
        SELECT 'shirt', 't-shirt', 8 UNION ALL
        SELECT NULL, 'polo', 25 UNION ALL
        SELECT 'pants', 'jeans', 6
      )
    SELECT
      product_type,
      product_name,
      SUM(product_count) AS product_sum,
      GROUPING(product_type) AS product_type_is_aggregated
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(product_type, product_name)
    ORDER BY product_name;

## `LOGICAL_AND`

    LOGICAL_AND(
      expression
    )

**Description**

Returns the logical AND of all non-`NULL` expressions. Returns `NULL` if there
are zero input rows or `expression` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows.

To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see

This function can be used with the
[`AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD` clause](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#agg_threshold_clause).

**Supported Argument Types**

`BOOL`

**Return Data Types**

`BOOL`

**Examples**

`LOGICAL_AND` returns `FALSE` because not all of the values in the array are
less than 3.

    SELECT LOGICAL_AND(x < 3) AS logical_and FROM UNNEST([1, 2, 4]) AS x;

    /*---+
     | logical_and |

     +---*/

## `LOGICAL_OR`

    LOGICAL_OR(
      expression
    )

**Description**

Returns the logical OR of all non-`NULL` expressions. Returns `NULL` if there
are zero input rows or `expression` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows.

Returns a value (either `STRING` or `BYTES`) obtained by concatenating
non-`NULL` values. Returns `NULL` if there are zero input rows or `expression`
evaluates to `NULL` for all rows.

If a `delimiter` is specified, concatenated values are separated by that
delimiter; otherwise, a comma is used as a delimiter.

To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
[Aggregate function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls).

If this function is used with the `OVER` clause, it's part of a
window function call. In a window function call,
aggregate function clauses can't be used.

      [ named_window ]
      [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
      [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
      [ window_frame_clause ]

**Description**

Returns the sum of non-`NULL` values in an aggregated group.

To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
[Aggregate function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls).

This function can be used with the
[`AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD` clause](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#agg_threshold_clause).

To learn more about the `OVER` clause and how to use it, see
[Window function calls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls).

`SUM` can be used with differential privacy. For more information, see
[Differentially private aggregate functions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-dp-functions).

Caveats:

- If the aggregated group is empty or the argument is `NULL` for all rows in the group, returns `NULL`.
- If the argument is `NaN` for any row in the group, returns `NaN`.
- If the argument is `[+|-]Infinity` for any row in the group, returns either `[+|-]Infinity` or `NaN`.
- If there is numeric overflow, produces an error.
- If a [floating-point type](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#floating_point_types) is returned, the result is [non-deterministic](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#floating_point_semantics), which means you might receive a different result each time you use this function.

**Supported Argument Types**

- Any supported numeric data type
- `INTERVAL`
