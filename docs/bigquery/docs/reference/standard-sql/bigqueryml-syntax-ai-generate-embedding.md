# The AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING function

This document describes the `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` function, a table-valued
function that
lets you create embeddings that describe an entity---for example,
a piece of text or an image.

Embeddings are high-dimensional numerical vectors that represent a given entity.
Machine learning models use embeddings to encode semantics about entities
to make it easier to reason about and compare them. If two entities are
semantically similar, then their respective embeddings are located near each
other in the embedding vector space. For more information, see the
[Introduction to embeddings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-search-intro).

You can create embeddings for the following types of data:

- Text data from standard tables.
- Visual data that is returned as [`ObjectRefRuntime`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objectrefruntime) values by the [`OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objget_access_url). You can use [`ObjectRef`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) values from standard tables as input to the `OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL` function.
- Visual data in [object tables](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction).
- Combinations of unstructured data, including text, images, audio, video, and PDFs, represented by a `STRUCT` that contains `STRING`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, `ObjectRef`, and `ARRAY<ObjectRef>` values.
- Output data from [PCA](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-pca), [autoencoder](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-autoencoder), or [matrix factorization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization) models.

## Function processing

Depending on the task, the `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` function works in one of the
following ways:

- To generate embeddings from text or visual content,
  `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` sends the request to a BigQuery ML
  [remote model](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model)
  that represents a
  [Vertex AI embedding model](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models#embeddings-models)
  or a
  [supported open model](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-open#supported_open_models),
  and then returns the model's response.

  The `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` function works with the Vertex AI
  model to perform embedding tasks supported by that model. For more information
  on the types of tasks these models can perform, see the following documentation:
  - [Text embedding model use cases](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings#text-use-cases)
  - [Multimodal embedding model use cases](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings#multimodal-use-cases)

  Typically, you want to use text embedding models for text-only use cases, and
  use multimodal models for cross-modal search use cases, where embeddings for
  text and visual content are generated in the same semantic space.
- For PCA and autoencoding, `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` processes the request using
  a BigQuery ML PCA or autoencoder model
  [`ML.PREDICT` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict).
  `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` gathers the `ML.PREDICT` output for the model into
  an array and outputs it as the `embedding` column.
  Having all of the embeddings in a single column lets you directly use the
  [`VECTOR_SEARCH` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search)
  on the`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` output.

- For matrix factorization, `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` processes the request using
  a BigQuery ML matrix factorization model and the
  [`ML.WEIGHTS` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-weights).
  `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` gathers the `factor_weights.weight` and `intercept`
  values from the `ML.WEIGHTS` output for the model into
  an array and outputs it as the `embedding` column.
  Having all of the embeddings in a single column lets you directly use the
  [`VECTOR_SEARCH` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search)
  on the`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` output.

## Syntax

`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` syntax differs depending on the
BigQuery ML model you choose. If you use a remote model, it also
differs depending on the Vertex AI model that your remote models
targets. To understand the differences between the different text embedding
models, see [Supported text embedding models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-generate-embedding#supported-text-models).

  this argument to provide an alias for an existing table column. An error
  occurs if no `content` column exists.

  <br />

- `QUERY_STATEMENT`: a query whose result contains a
  `STRING` column that's named `content`. For information about the
  supported SQL syntax of the `QUERY_STATEMENT` clause, see
  [GoogleSQL query
  syntax](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax).

  <br />

  <br />

- `TASK_TYPE`: a `STRING` literal that specifies the
  intended downstream application to help the model produce better quality
  embeddings. For a list of supported task types and how to choose which
  one to use, see
  [Choose an embeddings task type](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/task-types).

- `OUTPUT_DIMENSIONALITY`: an `INT64` value
  that specifies the number of dimensions to use when generating
  embeddings. For example, if you specify `256 AS output_dimensionality`,
  then the `embedding` output column contains a
  256-dimensional embedding for each input value.
  To find the supported range of output dimensions, read about the available
  [Google text embedding models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings#google-models).

  { TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.TABLE_NAME` | (QUERY_STATEMENT) },
  STRUCT(
    [, OUTPUT_DIMENSIONALITY AS output_dimensionality])
)
```

```googlesql

    [, END_SECOND AS end_second]
    [, INTERVAL_SECONDS AS interval_seconds]
    [, OUTPUT_DIMENSIONALITY AS output_dimensionality])
)
```

<br />

### Arguments

`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` takes the following arguments:

- `PROJECT_ID`: the project that contains the
  resource.

- `DATASET`: the BigQuery dataset that
  contains the resource.

- `MODEL_NAME`: the name of
  a remote model over a Vertex AI model.
  Supported models include `multimodalembedding@001` and
  `gemini-embedding-2-preview`
  ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)).


  You can confirm what LLM is used by the remote model by opening the
  Google Cloud console and looking at the **Remote endpoint** field in
  the model details page.

  <br />

- `TABLE_NAME`: one of the following:

  - If you are creating embeddings for text in
    a standard table, the name of the BigQuery table
    that contains the content. The content must be in a `STRING`
    column named `content`. If your table does not have a
    `content` column, use the `QUERY_STATEMENT` argument instead and
    provide a `SELECT` statement that includes an alias for an existing
    table column. An error occurs if no `content` column is available.

  - If you are creating embeddings for visual content using data from an
    an object table, the name of a BigQuery
    [object table](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction) that
    contains the visual content.

  - If you use the `gemini-embedding-2-preview` model
    ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)),
    you can also specify a `STRUCT` column that contains a
    combination of `STRING`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, `ObjectRef`,
    and `ARRAY<ObjectRef>` values.

  <br />

- `QUERY_STATEMENT`: the GoogleSQL query
  that generates the input data for the function.

  - If you are creating embeddings from a standard table, the query must
    produce a column named `content`, which you can generate as follows:

    - For text embeddings, you can pull the value from a `STRING`
      column, or you can specify a string literal in the query.

    - For visual content embeddings, you can provide an
      [`ObjectRefRuntime`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objectrefruntime)
      value for the `content` column. You can generate
      `ObjectRefRuntime` values by using the
      [`OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objget_access_url).
      The `OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL` function takes an
      [`ObjectRef`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/analyze-multimodal-data#objectref_values)
      value as input, which you can provide by either specifying
      the name of a column that contains `ObjectRef` values, or by
      constructing an `ObjectRef` value.

      `ObjectRefRuntime` values must have the `access_url.read_url` and
      `details.gcs_metadata.content_type` elements of the JSON value
      populated.
  - If you are creating embeddings from an object table, the query doesn't
    have to return a `content` column. You can only specify `WHERE`,
    `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` clauses in the query.

  <br />

- `START_SECOND`: a `FLOAT64` value that specifies the
  second in the video
  at which to start the embedding. The default value is `0`.
  If you specify this argument, you must
  also specify the `END_SECOND` argument. This value must be positive and
  less than the `END_SECOND` value. This argument only applies to video
  content.

- `END_SECOND`: a `FLOAT64` value that specifies the
  second in the video at which to end the embedding. The `END_SECOND` value
  can't be higher than `120`. The default value is `120`. If you specify
  this argument, you must also specify the `START_SECOND` argument. This
  value must be positive and greater than the `START_SECOND` value. This
  argument only applies to video content.

- `INTERVAL_SECONDS`: a `FLOAT64` value that specifies
  the interval to use when creating embeddings. For example, if you set
  `START_SECOND` = `0`, `END_SECOND` = `120`, and `INTERVAL_SECONDS` = `10`,
  then the video is split into twelve 10 second segments (`[0, 10), [10,
  20), [20, 30)...`) and embeddings are generated for each segment. This
  value must be greater than
  or equal to `4` and less than `120`. The default value is `16`.
  This argument only applies to video content.

- `OUTPUT_DIMENSIONALITY`: an `INT64` value that
  specifies the number of dimensions to use when generating embeddings.
  For more information, see how to
  [specify lower-dimensional embeddings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#low-dimension).

  You can only use this argument when creating text or image embeddings.
  If you use this argument when creating video embeddings, the function
  returns an error.

## Output

`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` returns the input table and the following columns:

### Text embedding


- `embedding`: an `ARRAY<FLOAT64>` value that contains the generated embedding vector.
- `statistics`: a `JSON` value that contains a `token_count` field with the number of tokens in the content, and a `truncated` field that indicates whether the content was truncated.
- `status`: a `STRING` value that contains the API response status for the corresponding row. This value is empty if the operation was successful.

  <br />

### Open models


- `embedding`: an `ARRAY<FLOAT64>` value that contains the generated embedding vector.
- `status`: a `STRING` value that contains the API response status for the corresponding row. This value is empty if the operation was successful.

  <br />

### Multimodal embedding


- `embedding`: an `ARRAY<FLOAT64>` value that contains the generated embedding vector.
- `status`: a `STRING` value that contains the API response status for the corresponding row. This value is empty if the operation was successful.
- Additional output fields depend on which embedding model you use:

  - The `gemini-embedding-2-preview` model also outputs the following field:

    - `statistics`: a `JSON` value that contains information about the token count for each modality of input that you provide.
  - The `multimodalembedding@001` model also outputs the following fields:

    - `video_start_sec`: for video content, an `INT64` value
      that contains the starting second of the portion of the video that the
      embedding represents. For image content, the value is `NULL`.
      This column isn't returned for text content.

    - `video_end_sec`: for video content, an `INT64` value
      that contains the ending second of the portion of the video that the
      embedding represents. For image content, the value is `NULL`.
      This column isn't returned for text content.


### PCA


- `embedding`: an `ARRAY<FLOAT>` value that
  contains the principal components for the input data. The number of array
  dimensions is equal to the PCA model's
  [`NUM_PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS` option](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-pca#num_principal_components)
  value if that option is used when the model is created. If the
  [`PCA_EXPLAINED_VARIANCE_RATIO` option](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-pca#pca_explained_variance_ratio) is used
  instead, the array dimensions vary depending on the input table and
  the option ratio determined by BigQuery ML.


### Autoencoder


- `embedding`: an `ARRAY<FLOAT>` value that
  contains the latent space dimensions for the input data.
  The number of array dimensions is equal to the number in the middle
  of the autoencoder model's
  [`HIDDEN_UNITS` option](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-autoencoder#hidden_units)
  array value.

  trial used by the function. This column is only returned if you ran
  hyperparameter tuning when creating the model.

### Matrix factorization


- `embedding`: an `ARRAY<FLOAT>` value that
  contains the weights of the feature, and also the intercept or bias term
  for the feature. The intercept value is the last value in the array.
  The number of array dimensions is equal to the matrix factorization
  model's
  [`NUM_FACTORS` option](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization#num_factors)
  value.

- `trial_id`: an `INT64` value that identifies the hyperparameter tuning
  trial used by the function. This column is only returned if you ran
  hyperparameter tuning when creating the model.

- `processed_input`: a `STRING` value that contains the name of the user or
  item column. The value of this column matches the name of the
  user or item column provided in the
  [`query_statement` clause](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#query_statement)
  that was used when the matrix factorization model was trained.

- `feature`: a `STRING` value that contains the names of the specific
  users or items used during training.

## Examples

### Text embedding

This example shows how to generate an embedding of a single piece of
sample text by using a remote model that references a
`text-embedding` model.

Create the remote model:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `mydataset.text_embedding`
  REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us.test_connection`
  OPTIONS(ENDPOINT = 'text-embedding-005')
```

Generate the embedding:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
    MODEL `mydataset.text_embedding`,
    (SELECT "Example text to embed" AS content)
);
```

The result is similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+---+
| embedding             | statistics                          | status | content               |
+---+---+---+---+
| -0.097711019217967987 | {"token_count":4,"truncated":false} |        | Example text to embed |
|  0.014618906192481518 |                                     |        |                       |
| ...                   |                                     |        |                       |
+---+---+---+---+
```

### Multimodal embedding

This example shows how to generate embeddings from visual content by using a
remote model that references a `multimodalembedding` model.

Create the remote model:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `mydataset.multimodalembedding`
  REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us.test_connection`
  OPTIONS(ENDPOINT = 'multimodalembedding@001')
```

**Use an `ObjectRefRuntime` value**

Generate embeddings from visual content in an `ObjectRef` column
in a standard table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
  MODEL `mydataset.multimodalembedding`,
    (
      SELECT OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL(art_image, 'r') as content
      FROM `mydataset.art`)
 );
```

**Use an object table**

Generate embeddings from visual content in an object table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
  MODEL `mydataset.multimodalembedding`,
  TABLE `mydataset.my_object_table`);
```

The following example creates a remote model using the
`gemini-embedding-2-preview` endpoint and then embeds
the combination of a text description and an image:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `mydataset.gemini-embedding-2-preview`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us.example_connection`
OPTIONS(ENDPOINT = 'gemini-embedding-2-preview');

SELECT *
FROM
  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
    MODEL `mydataset.gemini-embedding-2-preview`,
    (
      SELECT
        ('Made of tempered glass',
        OBJ.MAKE_REF('gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/images/aquaclear-20-gallon-aquarium.png')) AS content
    )
  )
```

### PCA

This example shows how to generate embeddings that represent the principal
components of a PCA model.

Create the PCA model:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `mydataset.pca_nyc_trees`
  OPTIONS (
    MODEL_TYPE = 'PCA',
    PCA_EXPLAINED_VARIANCE_RATIO = 0.9)
AS (
  SELECT
    tree_id,
    block_id,
    tree_dbh,
    stump_diam,
    curb_loc,
    status,
    health,
    spc_latin
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york_trees.tree_census_2015`
);
```

Generate embeddings that represent principal components:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
    MODEL `mydataset.pca_nyc_trees`,
(
  SELECT
    tree_id,
    block_id,
    tree_dbh,
    stump_diam,
    curb_loc,
    status,
    health,
    spc_latin
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york_trees.tree_census_2015`
));
```

### Autoencoder

This example shows how to generate embeddings that represent the latent space
dimensions of an autoencoder model.

Create the autoencoder model:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `mydataset.my_autoencoder_model`
  OPTIONS (
    model_type = 'autoencoder',
    activation_fn = 'relu',
    batch_size = 8,
    dropout = 0.2,
    hidden_units =
      [
        32,
        16,
        4,
        16,
        32],
    learn_rate = 0.001,
    l1_reg_activation = 0.0001,
    max_iterations = 10,
    optimizer = 'adam')
AS
SELECT * EXCEPT (
    Time,
    Class)
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection`;
```

Generate embeddings that represent latent space dimensions:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
    MODEL `mydataset.my_autoencoder_model`,
    TABLE `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection`);
```

### Matrix factorization

This example shows how to generate embeddings that represent the underlying
weights that the matrix factorization model uses during prediction.

Create the matrix factorization model:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
  `mydataset.my_mf_model`
OPTIONS (
  model_type='matrix_factorization',
  user_col='user_id',
  item_col='item_id',
  l2_reg=9.83,
  num_factors=34)
AS SELECT
  user_id,
  item_id,
  AVG(rating) as rating
FROM
  movielens.movielens_1m
GROUP BY user_id, item_id;
```

Generate embeddings that represent model weights and intercepts:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(MODEL `mydataset.my_mf_model`)
```

## Supported text embedding models

The following tables show the available Google and open text embedding models.

### Google models

You can get text embeddings by using the following models:

| Model name | Description | Output Dimensions | Max sequence length | Supported text languages |

| `gemini-embedding-001` | State-of-the-art performance across English, multilingual and code tasks. It unifies the previously specialized models like `text-embedding-005` and `text-multilingual-embedding-002` and achieves better performance in their respective domains. Read our [Tech Report](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/157741/) for more detail. | up to 3072 | 2048 tokens | [Supported text languages](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-embeddings-api#supported_text_languages) |
| `text-embedding-005` | Specialized in English and code tasks. | up to 768 | 2048 tokens | English |
| `text-multilingual-embedding-002` | Specialized in multilingual tasks. | up to 768 | 2048 tokens | [Supported text languages](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-embeddings-api#supported_text_languages) |

For superior embedding quality, `gemini-embedding-001` is our large
model designed to provide the highest performance.

### Open models

You can get text embeddings by using the following models:

| Model name | Description | Output dimensions | Max sequence length | Supported text languages |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `multilingual-e5-small` | Part of the E5 family of text embedding models. Small variant contains 12 layers. | Up to 384 | 512 tokens | [Supported languages](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small#supported-languages) |
| `multilingual-e5-large` | Part of the E5 family of text embedding models. Large variant contains 24 layers. | Up to 1024 | 512 tokens | [Supported languages](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small#supported-languages) |

To get started, see the E5 family [model
card](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/intfloat/model-garden/multilingual-e5-large-instruct-maas).
For more information on open models, see [Open models for MaaS](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/maas/use-open-models)

## Supported multimodal content

You can use the
`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING`
function to generate embeddings for different modalities that meet the requirements described in
[API limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#api-limits).

| Model name | Supported data types | Output dimensions | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-embedding-2-preview` (\[Preview\](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)) | Text, image, video, audio, PDF | Up to 3072 | Multimodal model supporting a wide range of inputs. (Preview) |
| `multimodalembedding@001` | Text, image, video | Up to 1408 | Generates embeddings for text, images, and video. |

There is no limitation on the length of the video files you can use
with this function. However, the function only processes the first two minutes
of a video. If a video is longer than two minutes, the
`AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING`
function only returns embeddings for the first two minutes.


## Known issues

Sometimes after a query job that uses this function finishes successfully,
some returned rows contain the following error message:

    A retryable error occurred: RESOURCE EXHAUSTED error from <remote endpoint>

This issue occurs because BigQuery query jobs finish successfully
even if the function fails for some of the rows. The function fails when the
volume of API calls to the remote endpoint exceeds the quota limits for that
service. This issue occurs most often when you are running multiple parallel
batch queries. BigQuery retries these calls, but if the retries
fail, the `resource exhausted` error message is returned.

To iterate through inference calls until all rows are successfully processed,
you can use the
[BigQuery remote inference SQL scripts](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-ml-utils/tree/master/sql_scripts/remote_inference)
or the
[BigQuery remote inference pipeline Dataform package](https://github.com/dataform-co/dataform-bqml).

## Locations

The `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` function must run in the same
[region or multi-region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) as the model that the
function references. For more information on supported regions for
embedding models, see
[Google model endpoint locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#google_model_endpoint_locations).
Embedding models are also available in the `US` multi-region.

## Quotas

Quotas apply when you use the `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` function with remote
models. For more information, see [Vertex AI and Cloud AI service
functions quotas and limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#cloud_ai_service_functions).

For the `multimodalembedding` model, the
default requests per minute (RPM) for non-`EU` regions is 600.
The default RPM for `EU` regions is 120. However, you can request a quota
increase in order to increase throughput.

To increase quota, first request more quota for the Vertex AI
`multimodalembedding` model by using the process described in
[Manage your quota using the console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage#managing_your_quota_console).
