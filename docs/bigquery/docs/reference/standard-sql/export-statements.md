# Export statements in GoogleSQL

## `EXPORT DATA` statement

The `EXPORT DATA` statement exports the results of a query to an external
storage location. You can export to the following services:

- Cloud Storage
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- Azure Blob Storage
- Spanner
- Bigtable
- Pub/Sub
- AlloyDB ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages))

### Syntax

```
EXPORT DATA
[WITH CONNECTION connection_name]
OPTIONS (export_option_list) AS
query_statement
```

### Arguments

- `connection_name`: Specifies a
  [connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/connections-api-intro) that has
  credentials for accessing the Amazon S3 data. Specify the connection name in
  the form `PROJECT_ID.LOCATION.CONNECTION_ID`.
  If the project ID or location contains a dash, enclose the connection name in
  backticks (`` ` ``). Connections aren't required to export to
  Google Cloud services.

- `export_option_list`: Specifies a list of options
  for the export operation, including the URI of the destination. For more
  information, see the following sections:

  - [Cloud Storage, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Blob Storage export option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/export-statements#gcs_s3_export_option)
  - [Bigtable export option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/export-statements#bigtable_export_option)
  - [Pub/Sub export option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/export-statements#pubsub_export_option)
  - [Spanner export option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/export-statements#spanner_export_option)
  - [AlloyDB export option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/export-statements#alloydb_export_option)
- `query_statement`: A SQL query. The query result is exported to the external
  destination. The query can't reference metatables, including
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views, system tables, or wildcard tables.

## Export to Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, or Blob Storage

You can
export BigQuery data to Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, or Blob Storage
in Avro, CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats. For more information about exporting to
Cloud Storage, see
[Export table data to Cloud Storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data).

Use the `format` option to specify the format of the exported data. The
following limitations apply:

- You cannot export nested and repeated data in CSV format.
- If you export data in JSON format, `INT64` data types are encoded as JSON strings to preserve 64-bit precision.

You are not billed for the export operation, but you are billed for running the
query and for storing data in Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, or
Blob Storage. For more information, see [Cloud Storage
pricing](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing), [Amazon S3
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing), or [Blob Storage
pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

### Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Blob Storage export option list

The option list specifies options for exporting to Cloud Storage,
Amazon S3, or Blob Storage.

| Options ||
|---|---|
| `compression` | `STRING` Specifies a compression format. If not specified, the exported files are uncompressed. Supported values include: `GZIP`, `DEFLATE`, `SNAPPY`. |
| `field_delimiter` | `STRING` The delimiter used to separate fields. Default: `','` (comma). Applies to: CSV. |
| `format` | `STRING` Required. The format of the exported data. Supported values include: `AVRO`, `CSV`, `JSON`, `PARQUET`. |
| `header` | `BOOL` If `true`, generates column headers for the first row of each data file. Default: `false`. Applies to: CSV. |
| `overwrite` | `BOOL` If `true`, overwrites any existing files with the same URI. Otherwise, if the destination storage bucket is not empty, the statement returns an error. Default: `false`. Note: When `overwrite` is `true`, files are only overwritten, no files are ever deleted, even if they match the wildcard specified in the URI. |
| `uri` | `STRING` Required. The destination URI for the export. The `uri` option must be a single-wildcard URI as described in [Exporting data into one or more files](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data#exporting_data_into_one_or_more_files). Examples: `"gs://bucket/path/file_*.csv"` or `"s3://bucket/path/file_*.csv"` |
| `use_avro_logical_types` | `BOOL` Whether to use appropriate AVRO logical types when exporting `TIMESTAMP`, `DATETIME`, `TIME` and `DATE` types. Applies to: AVRO. For more information, see [Avro export details](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data#avro_export_details). |

### Examples

The following examples show common use cases for exporting to
Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, or Blob Storage.

#### Export data to Cloud Storage in CSV format

The following example exports data to a CSV file. It includes options to
overwrite the destination location, write header rows, and use `';'` as a
delimiter.

```sql
EXPORT DATA OPTIONS(
  uri='gs://bucket/folder/*.csv',
  format='CSV',
  overwrite=true,
  header=true,
  field_delimiter=';') AS
SELECT field1, field2 FROM mydataset.table1 ORDER BY field1 LIMIT 10
```

#### Export data to Cloud Storage in Avro format

The following example exports data to Avro format using Snappy compression.

```sql
EXPORT DATA OPTIONS(
  uri='gs://bucket/folder/*',
  format='AVRO',
  compression='SNAPPY') AS
SELECT field1, field2 FROM mydataset.table1 ORDER BY field1 LIMIT 10
```

#### Export data to Cloud Storage in Parquet format

The following example exports data to Parquet format. It includes the option to
overwrite the destination location.

```sql
EXPORT DATA OPTIONS(
  uri='gs://bucket/folder/*',
  format='PARQUET',
  overwrite=true) AS
SELECT field1, field2 FROM mydataset.table1 ORDER BY field1 LIMIT 10
```

#### Export data to Amazon S3 in JSON format

The following example [exports query results](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/omni-aws-export-results-to-s3)
that run against a BigLake table based on Amazon S3 to
your Amazon S3 bucket:

```sql
EXPORT DATA
  WITH CONNECTION myproject.us.myconnection
  OPTIONS(
  uri='s3://bucket/folder/*',
  format='JSON',
  overwrite=true) AS
SELECT field1, field2 FROM mydataset.table1 ORDER BY field1 LIMIT 10
```

## Export to Bigtable

You can export BigQuery data to a Bigtable table
by using the `EXPORT DATA` statement. For Bigtable export
examples and configuration options, see
[Export data to Bigtable](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/export-to-bigtable).

You are not billed for the export operation, but you are billed for
running the query and for storing data in Bigtable. For more
information, see [Bigtable pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/pricing).

### Bigtable export option list

The option list specifies options for exporting to Bigtable.

| Options ||
|---|---|
| `format` | `STRING` Required. When exporting to Bigtable, the value must always be `CLOUD_BIGTABLE`. |
| `bigtable_options` | `STRING` JSON string containing configurations related to mapping exported fields to Bigtable columns families and columns. For more information, see [Configure exports with `bigtable_options`.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/export-to-bigtable#bigtable_options) |
| `overwrite` | `BOOL` If `true`, allows export to overwrite existing data in the destination Bigtable table. When set to `false`, and if the destination table is not empty, the statement returns an error. Default: `false`. |
| `truncate` | `BOOL` If `true`, all existing data in the destination table will be deleted before any new data is written. Otherwise the export will proceed with a non-empty destination table. Default: `false`. > [!WARNING] > **Warning:** Only use `truncate` when the destination table doesn't contain data that needs to be retained. |
| `uri` | `STRING` Required. The destination URI for the export. We recommend specifying an app profile for traffic routing and visibility at monitoring dashboards provided by Bigtable. The `uri` option for a Bigtable export must be provided in the following format: ` https://bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/instances/INSTANCE_ID/appProfiles/APP_PROFILE/tables/TABLE_NAME ` |
| `auto_create_column_families` | `BOOL` If `true`, allows export to create missing column families in the target table. If `false` and if the destination table is missing a column family, the statement returns an error. Default: `false`. |

### Example

The following example exports data to a Bigtable table. Data in
`field1` becomes a row key in Bigtable destination table. The
fields `field2`, `field3` and `field4` are written as columns `cbtFeld2`,
`cbtField3` and `cbtField4` into column family `column_family`.

```sql
EXPORT DATA OPTIONS (
uri="https://bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/instances/my-instance/tables/my-table",
format="CLOUD_BIGTABLE",
bigtable_options="""{
   "columnFamilies" : [
      {
        "familyId": "column_family",
        "columns": [
           {"qualifierString": "cbtField2", "fieldName": "field2"},
           {"qualifierString": "cbtField3", "fieldName": "field3"},
           {"qualifierString": "cbtField4", "fieldName": "field4"},
        ]
      }
   ]
}"""
) AS
SELECT
CAST(field1 as STRING) as rowkey,
STRUCT(field2, field3, field4) as column_family
FROM `bigquery_table`
```

## Export to Pub/Sub

You can export BigQuery data to a Pub/Sub topic
by using the `EXPORT DATA` statement in a
[continuous query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/continuous-queries-introduction). For
more information about Pub/Sub configuration options, see
[Export data to Pub/Sub](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/export-to-pubsub).
