The [HyperLogLog++ algorithm (HLL++)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) estimates
[cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) from sketches.

HLL++ functions are approximate aggregate functions.
Approximate aggregation typically requires less
memory than exact aggregation functions,
like [`COUNT(DISTINCT)`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#count), but also introduces statistical error.
This makes HLL++ functions appropriate for large data streams for
which linear memory usage is impractical, as well as for data that is
already approximate.

A data sketch is a compact summary of a data aggregation. If you don't need
materialized sketches, you can alternatively use an
[approximate aggregate function with system-defined precision](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions),
such as [`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions#approx_count_distinct). However,
`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` doesn't allow partial aggregations, re-aggregations,
and custom precision.

GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports the following HLL++ functions.

## `HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT`

    HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(sketch)

**Description**

A scalar function that extracts a cardinality estimate of a single
[HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) sketch.

If `sketch` is `NULL`, this function returns a cardinality estimate of `0`.

**Supported input types**

`BYTES`

**Return type**

`INT64`

**Example**

The following query returns the number of distinct users for each country who
have at least one invoice.

    SELECT
      country,
      HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(HLL_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice
    FROM
      (
        SELECT
          country,
          HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch
        FROM
          UNNEST(
            ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
              ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
              ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
              ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
              ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
              ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
              ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
        GROUP BY country
      );

    /*---+---+
     | country | distinct_customers_with_open_invoice |
     +---+---+
     | UA      |                                    2 |

     +---+---*/

## `HLL_COUNT.INIT`

    HLL_COUNT.INIT(input [, precision])

**Description**

An aggregate function that takes one or more `input` values and aggregates them
into a [HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) sketch. Each sketch
is represented using the `BYTES` data type. You can then merge sketches using
`HLL_COUNT.MERGE` or `HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL`. If no merging is needed,
you can extract the final count of distinct values from the sketch using
`HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT`.

This function supports an optional parameter, `precision`. This parameter
defines the accuracy of the estimate at the cost of additional memory required
to process the sketches or store them on disk. The range for this value is
`10` to `24`. The default value is `15`. For more information about precision,
see [Precision for sketches](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sketches#precision_hll).

If the input is `NULL`, this function returns `NULL`.

For more information, see [HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic Engineering of
a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf).

**Supported input types**

- `INT64`
- `NUMERIC`
- `BIGNUMERIC`
- `STRING`
- `BYTES`

**Return type**

`BYTES`

**Example**

The following query creates HLL++ sketches that count the number of distinct
users with at least one invoice per country.

    SELECT
      country,
      HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id, 10)
        AS hll_sketch
    FROM
      UNNEST(
        ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
          ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
          ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
          ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
          ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
          ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
    GROUP BY country;

    /*---+---+
     | country | hll_sketch                                                                         |

## `HLL_COUNT.MERGE`

    HLL_COUNT.MERGE(sketch)

**Description**

An aggregate function that returns the cardinality of several
[HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) sketches by computing their union.

Each `sketch` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches
for different types results in an error. For example, you can't merge a sketch
initialized from `INT64` data with one initialized from `STRING` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision
will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge.

This function ignores `NULL` values when merging sketches. If the merge happens
over zero rows or only over `NULL` values, the function returns `0`.

**Supported input types**

`BYTES`

**Return type**

`INT64`

**Example**

The following query counts the number of distinct users across all countries
who have at least one invoice.

    SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE(hll_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice
    FROM
      (
        SELECT
          country,
          HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch
        FROM
          UNNEST(
            ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
              ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
              ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
              ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
              ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
              ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
              ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
        GROUP BY country
      );

    /*---+
     | distinct_customers_with_open_invoice |
     +---+
     |                                    3 |
     +---*/

## `HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL`

    HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL(sketch)

**Description**

An aggregate function that takes one or more
[HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) `sketch`
inputs and merges them into a new sketch.

Each `sketch` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches
for different types results in an error. For example, you can't merge a sketch
initialized from `INT64` data with one initialized from `STRING` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision
will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge. For example,
if `MERGE_PARTIAL` encounters sketches of precision 14 and 15, the returned new
sketch will have precision 14.

This function returns `NULL` if there is no input or all inputs are `NULL`.

**Supported input types**

`BYTES`

**Return type**

`BYTES`

**Example**

The following query returns an HLL++ sketch that counts the number of distinct
users who have at least one invoice across all countries.

    SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL(HLL_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice
    FROM
      (
        SELECT
          country,
          HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch
        FROM
          UNNEST(
            ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
              ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
              ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
              ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
              ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
              ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
              ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
        GROUP BY country
      );
