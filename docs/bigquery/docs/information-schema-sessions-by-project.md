# SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT view

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT` view contains real-time
metadata about all BigQuery sessions in the current project.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The view names `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT` are synonymous and can be used interchangeably.

## Required permissions

To query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT` view, you need
the `bigquery.jobs.listAll` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission for the project.
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the
required permission:

- Project Owner
- BigQuery Admin

For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
[Access control with IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).

## Schema

When you query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_*` views, the query results
contain one row for each BigQuery session.

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_*` view has the following schema:

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The underlying data is partitioned by the `creation_time` column and clustered by `project_id` and `user_email`.

| Column name | Data type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `creation_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | (*Partitioning column*) Creation time of this session. Partitioning is based on the UTC time of this timestamp. |
| `expiration_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | (*Partitioning column*) Expiration time of this session. Partitioning is based on the UTC time of this timestamp. |
| `is_active` | `BOOL` | Is the session is still active? `TRUE` if yes, otherwise `FALSE`. |
| `last_modified_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | (*Partitioning column*) Time when the session was last modified. Partitioning is based on the UTC time of this timestamp. |
| `project_id` | `STRING` | (*Clustering column*) ID of the project. |
| `project_number` | `INTEGER` | Number of the project. |
| `session_id` | `STRING` | ID of the session. For example, `bquxsession_1234`. |
| `user_email` | `STRING` | (*Clustering column*) Email address or service account of the user who ran the session. |

For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard (`SELECT *`). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.

## Data retention

This view contains currently running sessions and the history of sessions
completed in the past 180 days.

## Scope and syntax

Queries against this view must include a [region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#syntax).
If you do not specify a regional qualifier, metadata is retrieved from all
regions. The following table explains the region scope for this view:

| View name | Resource scope | Region scope |
|---|---|---|
| ``[PROJECT_ID.]`region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT`` | Project level | `REGION` |

Replace the following:

- Optional: `PROJECT_ID`: the ID of your Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
- `REGION`: any [dataset region name](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations). For example, `` `region-us` ``.

  <br />

  <br />

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Note:** You must use [a region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#region_qualifier) to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view.

<br />

## Example

To run the query against a project other than your default project, add the
project ID in the following format:

```bash
`PROJECT_ID`.`region-REGION_NAME`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT
```
For example, `` `myproject`.`region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT ``. The following example lists all users or service accounts that created sessions for a given project within the last day:

<br />

```googlesql
SELECT
  DISTINCT(user_email) AS user
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE
  is_active = true
  AND creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view names are case-sensitive.

The result is similar to the following:

```
+---+
| user         |
+---+
| abc@xyz.com  |
+---+
| def@xyz.com  |
+---+
```
