# STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER view

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER` view contains per minute
aggregated streaming statistics for the parent folder of the current project,
including its subfolders.

You can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` streaming views
to retrieve historical and real-time information about streaming data into
BigQuery that uses the legacy [`tabledata.insertAll` method](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/tabledata/insertAll)
and not the [BigQuery Storage Write API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api). For more information about streaming data into
BigQuery, see [Streaming data into BigQuery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/streaming-data-into-bigquery).

## Required permission

To query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER` view, you need
the `bigquery.tables.list` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission for the parent
folder of the project.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the preceding
permission:

- `roles/bigquery.admin`
- `roles/bigquery.user`
- `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`
- `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`
- `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`
- `roles/bigquery.metadataViewer`
- `roles/bigquery.resourceAdmin`

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution:** The required \`bigquery.tables.list\` permission is *not* included in the [basic roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control-basic-roles) Owner or Editor.

For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
[Access control with IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).

## Schema

When you query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` streaming views, the query results contain historical and real-time information about streaming data into BigQuery. Each row in the following views represents statistics for streaming into a specific table, aggregated over a one minute interval starting at `start_timestamp`. Statistics are grouped by error code, so there will be one row for each error code encountered during the one minute interval for each timestamp and table combination. Successful requests have the error code set to `NULL`. If no data was streamed into a table during a certain time period, then no rows are present for the corresponding timestamps for that table.

<br />

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER` view has the following schema:

| Column name | Data type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `start_timestamp` | `TIMESTAMP` | *(Partitioning column)* Start timestamp of the 1 minute interval for the aggregated statistics. |
| `folder_numbers` | `REPEATED INTEGER` | Number IDs of folders that contain the project, starting with the folder that immediately contains the project, followed by the folder that contains the child folder, and so forth. For example, if `folder_numbers` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then folder `1` immediately contains the project, folder `2` contains `1`, and folder `3` contains `2`. This column is only populated in `STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER`. |
| `project_id` | `STRING` | *(Clustering column)* ID of the project. |
| `project_number` | `INTEGER` | Number of the project. |
| `dataset_id` | `STRING` | *(Clustering column)* ID of the dataset. |
| `table_id` | `STRING` | *(Clustering column)* ID of the table. |
| `error_code` | `STRING` | Error code returned for the requests specified by this row. NULL for successful requests. |
| `total_requests` | `INTEGER` | Total number of requests within the 1 minute interval. |
| `total_rows` | `INTEGER` | Total number of rows from all requests within the 1 minute interval. |
| `total_input_bytes` | `INTEGER` | Total number of bytes from all rows within the 1 minute interval. |

For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard (`SELECT *`). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.

## Data retention

This view contains the streaming history of the past 180 days.

## Scope and syntax

Queries against this view must include a [region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#syntax).
If you don't specify a regional qualifier, metadata is retrieved from all
regions. The following table explains the region scope for this view:

| View name | Resource scope | Region scope |
|---|---|---|
| ``[PROJECT_ID.]`region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER`` | Folder that contains the specified project | <var translate="no">REGION</var> |

Replace the following:

- Optional: `PROJECT_ID`: the ID of your Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
- `REGION`: any [dataset region name](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations). For example, `` `region-us` ``.

  <br />

  <br />

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Note:** You must use [a region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#region_qualifier) to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view.

<br />

**Example**

- To query data in the US multi-region, use `region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER`
- To query data in the EU multi-region, use `region-eu.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER`
- To query data in the asia-northeast1 region, use `region-asia-northeast1.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER`

For a list of available regions, see [Dataset locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations).

## Examples

##### Example 1: Recent streaming failures

The following example calculates the per minute breakdown of total failed
requests for all tables in the project's folder in the last 30 minutes, split by
error code:

```googlesql
SELECT
  start_timestamp,
  error_code,
  SUM(total_requests) AS num_failed_requests
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER
WHERE
  error_code IS NOT NULL
  AND start_timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 30 MINUTE)
GROUP BY
  start_timestamp,
  error_code
ORDER BY
  start_timestamp DESC;
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view names are case-sensitive.

The result is similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+
|   start_timestamp   |    error_code    | num_failed_requests |
+---+---+---+
| 2020-04-15 20:55:00 | INTERNAL_ERROR   |                  41 |
| 2020-04-15 20:41:00 | CONNECTION_ERROR |                   5 |
| 2020-04-15 20:30:00 | INTERNAL_ERROR   |                 115 |
+---+---+---+
```

##### Example 2: Per minute breakdown for all requests with error codes

The following example calculates a per minute breakdown of successful and failed
streaming requests in the project's folder, split into error code categories.
This query could be used to populate a dashboard.

```googlesql
SELECT
  start_timestamp,
  SUM(total_requests) AS total_requests,
  SUM(total_rows) AS total_rows,
  SUM(total_input_bytes) AS total_input_bytes,
  SUM(
    IF(
      error_code IN ('QUOTA_EXCEEDED', 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED'),
      total_requests,
      0)) AS quota_error,
  SUM(
    IF(
      error_code IN (
        'INVALID_VALUE', 'NOT_FOUND', 'SCHEMA_INCOMPATIBLE',
        'BILLING_NOT_ENABLED', 'ACCESS_DENIED', 'UNAUTHENTICATED'),
      total_requests,
      0)) AS user_error,
  SUM(
    IF(
      error_code IN ('CONNECTION_ERROR','INTERNAL_ERROR'),
      total_requests,
      0)) AS server_error,
  SUM(IF(error_code IS NULL, 0, total_requests)) AS total_error,
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER
GROUP BY
  start_timestamp
ORDER BY
  start_timestamp DESC;
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view names are case-sensitive.

The result is similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   start_timestamp   | total_requests | total_rows | total_input_bytes | quota_error | user_error | server_error | total_error |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 2020-04-15 22:00:00 |         441854 |     441854 |       23784853118 |           0 |          0 |           17 |          17 |

| 2020-04-15 21:57:00 |         298823 |     298823 |       23877821442 |           0 |          2 |            0 |           2 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

##### Example 3: Tables with the most incoming traffic

The following example returns the streaming statistics for the 10 tables in the
project's folder with the most incoming traffic:

```googlesql
SELECT
  project_id,
  dataset_id,
  table_id,
  SUM(total_rows) AS num_rows,
  SUM(total_input_bytes) AS num_bytes,
  SUM(total_requests) AS num_requests
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STREAMING_TIMELINE_BY_FOLDER
GROUP BY
  project_id,
  dataset_id,
  table_id
ORDER BY
  num_bytes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view names are case-sensitive.

The result is similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
