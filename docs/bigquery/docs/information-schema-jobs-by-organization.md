# JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION view

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` view contains near real-time
metadata about all jobs submitted in the organization that is associated with
the current project.

## Required role


To get the permission that
you need to query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` view,

ask your administrator to grant you the
[BigQuery Resource Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.resourceViewer) (`roles/bigquery.resourceViewer`) IAM role on your organization.


For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).


This predefined role contains the
`bigquery.jobs.listAll`
permission,
which is required to
query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` view.


You might also be able to get
this permission
with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or
other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined).

The schema table is only available to users with defined Google Cloud
organizations.

For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
[Access control with IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).

## Schema

The underlying data is partitioned by the `creation_time` column and
clustered by `project_id` and `user_email`. The `query_info` column contains
additional information about your query jobs.

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` view has the following schema:

| **Column name** | **Data type** | **Value** |
|---|---|---|
| `bi_engine_statistics` | `RECORD` | If the project is configured to use the [BI Engine](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bi-engine-intro), then this field contains [BiEngineStatistics](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#bienginestatistics). Otherwise `NULL`. |
| `cache_hit` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the query results of this job were from a cache. If you have a [multi-query statement job](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/multi-statement-queries), `cache_hit` for your parent query is `NULL`. |
| `creation_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | (*Partitioning column*) Creation time of this job. Partitioning is based on the UTC time of this timestamp. |
| `destination_table` | `RECORD` | Destination [table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/TableReference) for results, if any. |
| `end_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | The end time of this job, in milliseconds since the epoch. This field represents the time when the job enters the `DONE` state. |
| `error_result` | `RECORD` | Details of any errors as [ErrorProto](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/ErrorProto) objects. |
| `folder_numbers` | `REPEATED INTEGER` | Number IDs of folders that contain the project, starting with the folder that immediately contains the project, followed by the folder that contains the child folder, and so forth. For example, if `folder_numbers` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then folder `1` immediately contains the project, folder `2` contains `1`, and folder `3` contains `2`. This column is only populated in `JOBS_BY_FOLDER`. |
| `job_creation_reason.code` | `STRING` | Specifies the high level reason why a job was created. Possible values are: - `REQUESTED`: job creation was requested. - `LONG_RUNNING`: the query request ran beyond a system defined timeout specified by the [timeoutMs field in the `QueryRequest`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query#queryrequest). As a result it was considered a long running operation for which a job was created. - `LARGE_RESULTS`: the results from the query cannot fit in the in-line response. - `OTHER`: the system has determined that the query needs to be executed as a job. |
| `job_id` | `STRING` | The ID of the job if a job was created. Otherwise, the query ID of a query using optional job creation mode. For example, `bquxjob_1234`. |
| `job_stages` | `RECORD` | [Query stages](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#ExplainQueryStage) of the job. **Note** : This column's values are empty for queries that read from tables with row-level access policies. For more information, see [best practices for row-level security in BigQuery.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-row-level-security) |
| `job_type` | `STRING` | The type of the job. Can be `QUERY`, `LOAD`, `EXTRACT`, `COPY`, or `NULL`. A `NULL` value indicates a background job. |
| `labels` | `RECORD` | Array of labels applied to the job as key-value pairs. |

| `referenced_tables` | `RECORD` | Array of `STRUCT` values that contain the following `STRING` fields for each table referenced by the query: `project_id`, `dataset_id`, and `table_id`. Only populated for query jobs that are not cache hits. |
| `reservation_id` | `STRING` | Name of the primary reservation assigned to this job, in the format `RESERVATION_ADMIN_PROJECT:RESERVATION_LOCATION.RESERVATION_NAME`. In this output: - `RESERVATION_ADMIN_PROJECT`: the name of the Google Cloud project that administers the reservation - `RESERVATION_LOCATION`: the location of the reservation - `RESERVATION_NAME`: the name of the reservation |
| `edition` | `STRING` | The edition associated with the reservation assigned to this job. For more information about editions, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/editions-intro). |
| `session_info` | `RECORD` | Details about the [session](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sessions-intro) in which this job ran, if any. |
| `start_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | The start time of this job, in milliseconds since the epoch. This field represents the time when the job transitions from the `PENDING` state to either `RUNNING` or `DONE`. |
| `state` | `STRING` | Running state of the job. Valid states include `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, and `DONE`. |
| `statement_type` | `STRING` | The type of query statement. For example, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SCRIPT`, `SELECT`, or `UPDATE`. See [QueryStatementType](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs/rest/Shared.Types/BigQueryAuditMetadata.QueryStatementType) for list of valid values. |
| `timeline` | `RECORD` | [Query timeline](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#QueryTimelineSample) of the job. Contains snapshots of query execution. |
| `total_bytes_billed` | `INTEGER` | If the project is configured to use [on-demand pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#analysis_pricing_models), then this field contains the total bytes billed for the job. If the project is configured to use [flat-rate pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#analysis_pricing_models), then you are not billed for bytes and this field is informational only. **Note** : This column's values are empty for queries that read from tables with row-level access policies. For more information, see [best practices for row-level security in BigQuery.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-row-level-security) |
| `total_bytes_processed` | `INTEGER` | Total bytes processed by the job. **Note** : This column's values are empty for queries that read from tables with row-level access policies. For more information, see [best practices for row-level security in BigQuery.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-row-level-security) |
| `total_modified_partitions` | `INTEGER` | The total number of partitions the job modified. This field is populated for `LOAD` and `QUERY` jobs. |
| `total_slot_ms` | `INTEGER` | Slot milliseconds for the job over its entire duration in the `RUNNING` state, including retries. |
| `total_services_sku_slot_ms` | `INTEGER` | Total slot milliseconds for the job that runs on external services and is billed on the services SKU. This field is only populated for jobs that have external service costs, and is the total of the usage for costs whose billing method is `"SERVICES_SKU"`. |
| `transaction_id` | `STRING` | ID of the [transaction](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/transactions) in which this job ran, if any. |
| `user_email` | `STRING` | (*Clustering column*) Email address or service account of the user who ran the job. |
| `principal_subject` | `STRING` | A string representation of the identity of the principal that ran the job. |
| `query_info.resource_warning` | `STRING` | The warning message that appears if the resource usage during query processing is above the internal threshold of the system. A successful query job can have the `resource_warning` field populated. With `resource_warning`, you get additional data points to optimize your queries and to set up monitoring for performance trends of an equivalent set of queries by using `query_hashes`. |
| `query_info.query_hashes.normalized_literals` | `STRING` | Contains the hash value of the query. `normalized_literals` is a hexadecimal `STRING` hash that ignores comments, parameter values, UDFs, and literals. The hash value will differ when underlying views change, or if the query implicitly references columns, such as `SELECT *`, and the table schema changes. This field appears for successful [GoogleSQL](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) queries that are not cache hits. |
| `query_info.performance_insights` | `RECORD` | [Performance insights](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#PerformanceInsights) for the job. |

| `materialized_view_statistics` | `RECORD` | [Statistics of materialized views](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#MaterializedViewStatistics) considered in a query job. ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)) |
| `metadata_cache_statistics` | `RECORD` | [Statistics for metadata column index usage for tables](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#metadatacachestatistics) referenced in a query job. |
| `search_statistics` | `RECORD` | [Statistics for a search query.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#SearchStatistics) |
| `query_dialect` | `STRING` | This field will be available sometime in May, 2025. The query dialect used for the job. Valid values include: - `GOOGLE_SQL`: Job was requested to use GoogleSQL. - `LEGACY_SQL`: Job was requested to use LegacySQL. - `DEFAULT_LEGACY_SQL`: No query dialect was specified in the job request. BigQuery used the default value of LegacySQL. - `DEFAULT_GOOGLE_SQL`: No query dialect was specified in the job request. BigQuery used the default value of GoogleSQL. For jobs submitted by users, this field is only populated for query jobs. The default selection of query dialect can be controlled by the [configuration settings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/default-configuration#configuration-settings). For background jobs, the value of this field isn't controlled by the default query dialect configuration settings, and doesn't impact jobs submitted by users. For some background jobs, the value is omitted. |
| `continuous` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the job is a [continuous query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/continuous-queries-introduction). |
| `continuous_query_info.output_watermark` | `TIMESTAMP` | Represents the point up to which the continuous query has successfully processed data. |
| `vector_search_statistics` | `RECORD` | [Statistics for a vector search query.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#VectorSearchStatistics) |
| `external_service_costs` | `RECORD` | An array of information about the external service costs for a query job. |

For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard (`SELECT *`). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.

## Data retention

This view displays running jobs along with job history for the past 180 days.
If a project migrates to an organization (either from having no organization or
from a different one), job information predating the migration date isn't
accessible through the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` view, as the
view only retains data starting from the migration date.

## Scope and syntax

Queries against this view must include a [region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#syntax).
The following table explains the region scope for this view:

| View name | Resource scope | Region scope |
|---|---|---|
| ``[PROJECT_ID.]`region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION`` | Organization that contains the specified project | `REGION` |

Replace the following:

- Optional: `PROJECT_ID`: the ID of your Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
- `REGION`: any [dataset region name](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations). For example, `` `region-us` ``.

  <br />

  <br />

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Note:** You must use [a region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#region_qualifier) to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view.

<br />

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** When you query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` to find a summary cost of query jobs, exclude the `SCRIPT` statement type, otherwise some values might be counted twice. The `SCRIPT` row includes summary values for all child jobs that were executed as part of this job.

## Limitations

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION` view includes jobs run by
projects that belong to the current organization. Jobs run by projects from
other organizations aren't available in this view, even when those jobs
access resources in the current organization, such as shared datasets. For
example, if you share a dataset with a project from another organization,
any jobs that the project runs to access data in the dataset aren't included
in this view.

## Examples

To run the query against a project other than your default project, add the
project ID in the following format:

```bash
`PROJECT_ID`.`region-REGION_NAME`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION
```
Replace the following:

<br />

- `PROJECT_ID`: the ID of the project
- `REGION_NAME`: the region for your project

For example, `` `myproject`.`region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION ``.

### Find top five jobs that scanned the most bytes today

The following example demonstrates how to find the five jobs that scanned the
most bytes in an organization for the current day. You can filter further on
`statement_type` to query for additional information such as loads, exports,
and queries.

```googlesql
SELECT
  job_id,
  user_email,
  total_bytes_billed
FROM
  `region-REGION_NAME`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION
WHERE
  EXTRACT(DATE FROM  creation_time) = current_date()
ORDER BY
  total_bytes_billed DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view names are case-sensitive.

The result is similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+
| job_id       |  user_email  |  total_bytes_billed       |
+---+---+---+
| bquxjob_1    |  abc@xyz.com |    999999                 |
| bquxjob_2    |  def@xyz.com |    888888                 |
| bquxjob_3    |  ghi@xyz.com |    777777                 |
+---+---+---+
```

### Aggregate Connected Sheets usage by user at the organization level

The following query provides a summary of the top Connected Sheets
users in your organization over the last 30 days, ranked by their total
billed data. The query aggregates the total number of queries, total
bytes billed, and total slot milliseconds for each user. This information is
useful for understanding adoption and for identifying top consumers of
resources.

    SELECT
      user_email,
      COUNT(*) AS total_queries,
      SUM(total_bytes_billed) AS total_bytes_billed,
      SUM(total_slot_ms) AS total_slot_ms
    FROM
      `region-REGION_NAME.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION`
    WHERE
      -- Filter for jobs created in the last 30 days
      creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
      -- Filter for jobs originating from Connected Sheets
      AND job_id LIKE 'sheets_dataconnector%'
      -- Filter for completed jobs
      AND state = 'DONE'
      AND (statement_type IS NULL OR statement_type <> 'SCRIPT')
    GROUP BY
      1
    ORDER BY
      total_bytes_billed DESC;

Replace `REGION_NAME` with the region for your project.
For example, `region-us`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** You must use a region qualifier to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view.

The result looks similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+---+
| user_email          | total_queries | total_bytes_billed | total_slot_ms   |
+---+---+---+---+
| alice@example.com   | 152           | 12000000000        | 3500000         |
| bob@example.com     | 45            | 8500000000         | 2100000         |
| charles@example.com | 210           | 1100000000         | 1800000         |
+---+---+---+---+
```

### Find job logs of Connected Sheets queries at the organization-level

The following query provides a detailed log of every individual job run by
Connected Sheets. This information is useful for auditing and
identifying specific high-cost queries.

    SELECT
      job_id,
      creation_time,
      user_email,
      project_id,
      total_bytes_billed,
      total_slot_ms
    FROM
      `region-REGION_NAME.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION`
    WHERE
      creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
      AND job_id LIKE 'sheets_dataconnector%'
      AND state = 'DONE'
      AND (statement_type IS NULL OR statement_type <> 'SCRIPT')
    ORDER BY
      creation_time DESC;

Replace `REGION_NAME` with the region for your project.
For example, `region-us`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** You must use a region qualifier to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view.

The result looks similar to the following:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| job_id                          | creation_time                   | user_email      | project_id | total_bytes_billed | total_slot_ms |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| sheets_dataconnector_bquxjob_1  | 2025-11-06 00:26:53.077000 UTC  | abc@example.com | my_project | 12000000000        | 3500000       |
