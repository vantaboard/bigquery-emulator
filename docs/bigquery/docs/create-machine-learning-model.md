# Create a machine learning model in BigQuery ML by using SQL

This tutorial shows you how to create a logistic regression model by using
BigQuery ML SQL queries.

BigQuery ML lets you create and train machine learning models in
BigQuery by using SQL queries. This helps make machine learning more
approachable by letting you use familiar tools like the BigQuery
SQL editor, and also increases development speed by removing the need to move
data into a separate machine learning environment.

In this tutorial, you use the sample
[Google Analytics sample dataset for BigQuery](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7586738?ref_topic=3416089)
to create a model that predicts whether a website visitor will make a
transaction. For information on the schema of the Analytics dataset, see
[BigQuery export schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719)
in the Analytics Help Center.

To learn how to create models by using the Google Cloud console user interface, see
[work with models by using a UI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-machine-learning-model-console).

### BigQuery DataFrames

<br />

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart).
For more information, see the
[BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest).

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see [Set
up ADC for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment).


    import google.cloud.bigquery

    bqclient = google.cloud.https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest.https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html()
    bqclient.https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html#google_cloud_bigquery_client_Client_create_dataset("bqml_tutorial", exists_ok=True)

## Create a logistic regression model

Create a logistic regression model using the Analytics sample
dataset for BigQuery.

### SQL

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

   [Go to BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. In the query editor, run the following statement:

   ```googlesql
   CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`
   OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
   SELECT
   IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
   IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
   device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
   IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
   IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
   FROM
   `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
   WHERE
   _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'
   ```

   The query takes several minutes to complete. After the first iteration is
   complete, your model (`sample_model`) appears in the navigation panel.
   Because the query uses a `CREATE MODEL` statement to create a model, you don't
   see query results.

**Query details**

The `CREATE MODEL` statement creates the model and then trains the model
using the data retrieved by your query's `SELECT` statement.

The `OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg')` clause creates a [logistic
regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model. A
logistic regression model splits input data into two classes, and then
estimates the probability that the data is in one of the classes. What you are
trying to detect, such as whether an email is spam, is represented by 1 and
other values are represented by 0. The likelihood of a given value belonging
to the class you are trying to detect is indicated by a value between 0 and 1.
For example, if an email receives a probability estimate of 0.9, then there is
a 90% probability that the email is spam.

This query's `SELECT` statement retrieves the following columns that are used
by the model to predict the probability that a customer will complete a
transaction:

- `totals.transactions`: the total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. If the number of transactions is `NULL`, the value in the `label` column is set to `0`. Otherwise, it is set to `1`. These values represent the possible outcomes. Creating an alias named `label` is an alternative to setting the `input_label_cols=` option in the `CREATE MODEL` statement.
- `device.operatingSystem`: the operating system of the visitor's device.
- `device.isMobile` --- Indicates whether the visitor's device is a mobile device.
- `geoNetwork.country`: the country from which the sessions originated, based on the IP address.
- `totals.pageviews`: the total number of page views within the session.

The `FROM` clause --- causes the query to train the model by using the
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions` sample tables.
These tables are sharded by date, so you aggregate them by using a wildcard in
the table name: `google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`.

The `WHERE` clause --- `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'`
--- limits the number of tables scanned by the query. The date range
scanned is August 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.

    from bigframes.ml.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    import bigframes.pandas as bpd

    # Start by selecting the data you'll use for training. `read_gbq` accepts
    # either a SQL query or a table ID. Since this example selects from multiple
    # tables via a wildcard, use SQL to define this data. Watch issue
    # https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-dataframes/issues/169
    # for updates to `read_gbq` to support wildcard tables.

    df = bpd.read_gbq_table(
        "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*",
        filters=[
            ("_table_suffix", ">=", "20160801"),

    pageviews = df["totals"].struct.field("pageviews").fillna(0)

    # Combine all the feature columns into a single DataFrame

    features = bpd.DataFrame(
        {
            "os": operating_system,
            "is_mobile": is_mobile,
            "country": country,
            "pageviews": pageviews,

    )

    # Logistic Regression model splits data into two classes, giving the

    )

## View the model's loss statistics

Machine learning is about creating a model that can use data to make a
prediction. The model is essentially a function that takes inputs and applies
calculations to the inputs to produce an output --- a prediction.

Machine learning algorithms work by taking several examples where the
prediction is already known (such as the historical data of user purchases) and
iteratively adjusting various weights in the model so that the model's
predictions match the true values. It does this by minimizing how wrong the
model is using a metric called loss.

The expectation is that for each iteration, the loss should be decreasing,
ideally to zero. A loss of zero means the model is 100% accurate.

When training the model, BigQuery ML automatically splits the
input data into
[training and evaluation sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets),
in order to avoid [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)
the model. This is necessary so that the training algorithm doesn't fit itself
so closely to the training data that it can't generalize to new examples.

Use the Google Cloud console to see how the model's loss changes over the
model's training iterations:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

   [Go to BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. In the left pane, click **Explorer**:

   ![Highlighted button for the Explorer pane.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/bigquery/images/explorer-tab.png)

   If you don't see the left pane, click **Expand left pane** to open the pane.
3. In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** ,
   and then click the `bqml_tutorial` dataset.

4. Click the **Models** tab, and then click the `sample_model` model.

5. Click the **Training** tab and look at the **Loss** graph. The **Loss**
   graph shows the change in the loss metric over the iterations on the
   training dataset. If you hold your cursor over the graph, you can see that
   there are lines for **Training loss** and **Evaluation loss** . Since you
   performed a logistic regression, the training loss value is calculated as
   [log loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy#Cross-entropy_loss_function_and_logistic_regression), using
   the training data. The evaluation loss is the log loss calculated on the
   evaluation data. Both loss types represent average loss values, averaged
   over all examples in the respective datasets for each iteration.

You can also see the results of the model training by using the
[`ML.TRAINING_INFO` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-train).

## Evaluate the model

Evaluate the performance of the model by using the `ML.EVALUATE` function. The
`ML.EVALUATE` function evaluates the predicted values generated by the model
against the actual data. To calculate logistic regression specific
metrics, you can use the
[`ML.ROC_CURVE` SQL function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-roc)
or the
[`bigframes.ml.metrics.roc_curve` BigQuery DataFrames function](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.ml.metrics.roc_curve.html#bigframes.ml.metrics.roc_curve).

In this tutorial, you are using a binary classification model that
detects transactions. The values in the `label` column are the two classes
generated by the model: `0` (no transactions) and `1` (transaction made).

### SQL

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

   [Go to BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. In the query editor, run the following statement:

   ```googlesql
   SELECT
   *
   FROM
   ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`, (
   SELECT
   IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
   IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
   device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
   IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
   IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
   FROM
   `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
   WHERE
   _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
   ```

   The results should look like the following:

   <br />

   ```
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |     precision      |       recall        |      accuracy       |      f1_score       |      log_loss       | roc_auc                   |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | 0.468503937007874  | 0.11080074487895716 | 0.98534315834767638 | 0.17921686746987953 | 0.04624221101176898    | 0.98174125874125873 |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
     
   ```

   <br />

   Because you performed a logistic regression, the results include the following
   columns:
   - [`precision`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#precision):
     a metric for classification models. Precision identifies the frequency
     with which a model was correct when predicting the positive class.

   - [`recall`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#recall):
     a metric for classification models that answers the following
     question: Out of all the possible positive labels, how many did the model
     correctly identify?

   - [`accuracy`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#accuracy):
     accuracy is the fraction of predictions that a classification model
     got right.

   - [`f1_score`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score):
     a measure of the accuracy of the model. The f1 score is the harmonic average of
     the precision and recall. An f1 score's best value is 1. The worst value is 0.

   - [`log_loss`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_error_function_and_logistic_regression):
     the loss function used in a logistic regression. This is the measure
     of how far the model's predictions are from the correct labels.

   - [`roc_auc`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#AUC):
     the area under the [ROC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#ROC)
     curve. This is the probability that a classifier is more confident that a
     randomly chosen positive example is actually positive than that a randomly
     chosen negative example is positive. For more information, see
     [Classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/video-lecture)
     in the Machine Learning Crash Course.

**Query details**

The initial `SELECT` statement retrieves the columns from your model.

The `FROM` clause uses the `ML.EVALUATE` function against your model.

The nested `SELECT` statement and `FROM` clause are the same as those
in the `CREATE MODEL` query.

The `WHERE` clause --- `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'`
--- limits the number of tables scanned by the query. The date range
scanned is July 1, 2017 to August 1, 2017. This is the data you're using to
evaluate the predictive performance of the model. It was collected in the month
immediately following the time period spanned by the training data.

## Use the model to predict outcomes

Use the model to predict the number of transactions made by website visitors
from each country.

### SQL

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

   [Go to BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. In the query editor, run the following statement:

   ```googlesql
   SELECT
   country,
   SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
   FROM
   ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`, (
   SELECT
   IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
   device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
   IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,

   _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
   GROUP BY country
   ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
   LIMIT 10
   ```

   The results should look like the following:

   ```
   +---+---+
   |    country     | total_predicted_purchases |
   +---+---+
   | United States  |                       220 |
   | Taiwan         |                         8 |

   | Australia      |                         1 |
   +---+---+
   ```

**Query details**

The initial `SELECT` statement retrieves the `country` column and sums the
`predicted_label` column. The `predicted_label` column is generated by the
`ML.PREDICT` function. When you use the `ML.PREDICT` function, the output
column name for the model is `predicted_<label_column_name>`. For linear
regression models, `predicted_label` is the estimated value of `label`.
For logistic regression models, `predicted_label` is the label that best
describes the given input data value, either `0` or `1`.

The `ML.PREDICT` function is used to predict results using your model.

The nested `SELECT` statement and `FROM` clause are the same as those
in the `CREATE MODEL` query.

The `WHERE` clause --- `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'`
--- limits the number of tables scanned by the query. The date range
scanned is July 1, 2017 to August 1, 2017. This is the data for which you're
making predictions. It was collected in the month immediately following the time
period spanned by the training data.

The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses group the results by country and order
them by the sum of the predicted purchases in descending order.

The `LIMIT` clause is used here to display only the top 10 results.

## Predict purchases per user

Predict the number of transactions each website visitor will make.

### SQL

This query is identical to the query in the previous section except for the
`GROUP BY` clause. Here the `GROUP BY` clause --- `GROUP BY fullVisitorId`
--- is used to group the results by visitor ID.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

   [Go to BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. In the query editor, run the following statement:

   ```googlesql
   SELECT
   fullVisitorId,
   SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
   FROM
   ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`, (
   SELECT
   IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
   device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
   IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
   IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
   fullVisitorId
   FROM
   `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
   WHERE
   _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
   GROUP BY fullVisitorId
   ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
   LIMIT 10
   ```

   The results should look like the following:

   <br />

   ```
     +---+---+
     |    fullVisitorId    | total_predicted_purchases |
     +---+---+
     | 9417857471295131045 |                         4 |

## Clean up


To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.

You can delete the project you created, or keep the project and delete the
dataset.

### Delete the dataset

Deleting your project removes all datasets and all tables in the project. If you
prefer to reuse the project, you can delete the dataset you created in this
tutorial:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

   [Go to BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. In the left pane, click **Explorer**:

   ![Highlighted button for the Explorer pane.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/bigquery/images/explorer-tab.png)
3. In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** ,
   and then click the `bqml_tutorial` dataset that you created.

4. Click **Delete**.

5. In the **Delete dataset** dialog, confirm the delete command by typing
   `delete`.

6. Click **Delete**.

### Delete the project

To delete the project:

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:
>
> - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
> - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
>
>
> If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
> can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

   [Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)
2. In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.
3. In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
