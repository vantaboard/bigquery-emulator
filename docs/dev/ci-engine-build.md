# CI engine build pipeline

GitHub Actions builds the C++ engine (`emulator_main` + `libduckdb.so`) **once**
per push/PR in the [`build-engine`](../../.github/workflows/build-engine.yml)
workflow, runs first-party `cc_test` in the same job, and (on push to `main`
only) emits instrumented Bazel coverage. Downstream lanes download
`engine-binaries` instead of compiling GoogleSQL again.

## Flow

                │

                ├─► conformance / conformance (duckdb)

                ├─► thirdparty-samples / python nox snippets
                ├─► thirdparty-samples / node Mocha
                ├─► thirdparty-samples / golang live

                └─► coverage-publish (after ci or build-engine)
```

Consumer workflows (`ci`, `conformance`, `docker-smoke`, `thirdparty-samples`)
are **`workflow_run` only**. They never run on push, so they cannot show green
with skipped gate jobs. If `build-engine` fails, each consumer runs an
`engine-build-failed` job that exits non-zero.

[`coverage-publish`](../../.github/workflows/coverage-publish.yml) aggregates
Go coverage from `ci` and C++ coverage from the same `build-engine` run on
push to `main`. PR coverage gates use Go coverage from `ci` only; C++ Bazel
coverage is informational and runs post-merge inside `build-engine`.

Cheap push/PR workflows (no engine):

- [`ci-cpp-analysis.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci-cpp-analysis.yml)
- [`conformance-routing-matrix.yml`](../../.github/workflows/conformance-routing-matrix.yml)
- [`thirdparty-golang-compile.yml`](../../.github/workflows/thirdparty-golang-compile.yml)

## Caching

| Layer | Where | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `actions/cache` on `bin/` | `build-engine` | Skip Bazel when engine inputs + GoogleSQL pin unchanged **and** the cache key matches exactly |
| `actions/cache` on `.cache/googlesql-prebuilt/` | `build-engine` | Skip tarball download when prebuilt SHA256 pin unchanged |
| Bazel `disk-cache: engine` | `build-engine` | Shared incremental compile cache for engine, cc_test, and coverage |
| `engine-binaries` artifact | per successful `build-engine` run | Consumers + re-runs download without rebuilding |

### `bin/` cache safety (exact hit only)

The staged `bin/` cache is an all-or-nothing shortcut: when `actions/cache`
reports `cache-hit: true` for the full key (currently prefixed
`engine-binaries-v2-…`), `build-engine` skips Bazel if
`./bin/emulator_main --version` succeeds.

**Do not use `restore-keys` prefix fallback on `bin/`.** A partial restore can
leave pre-change `emulator_main` binaries that still pass `--version`; a
subsequent run can save them under the exact key and ship stale engines into
conformance and thirdparty consumers (2026-06 incident: SIGINT teardown mutex
fatals). Incremental compile speed belongs in the Bazel `disk-cache: engine`
layer, not prefix-matched staged binaries.

When the cache key does not match exactly, the workflow removes any restored
`bin/emulator_main` / `bin/libduckdb.so` and runs
`task emulator:build-engine:bazel`. Bump the `engine-binaries-vN` prefix in
[`.github/workflows/build-engine.yml`](../../.github/workflows/build-engine.yml)
only when invalidating poisoned or incompatible cached `bin/` trees.

`engine-provenance.json` in the uploaded artifact records
`engine_binaries_cache_key_version`, `engine_binaries_cache_hit` (exact
`actions/cache` match), and `cache_hit` (whether Bazel compile was skipped).

Re-running a failed consumer (e.g. conformance) on the same commit reuses the
artifact via [`.github/actions/setup-engine-from-artifact`](../../.github/actions/setup-engine-from-artifact/action.yml),
which locates the latest successful `build-engine` run for the SHA when no
explicit run id is passed.

## Branch protection

**Engine pipeline (required):**

- `build-engine / build`
- `ci / build-and-test (amd64)`
- `conformance / conformance (duckdb)`
- `docker-smoke / quickstart-smoke`
- `thirdparty-samples / java-bigquery-tests (live emulator)`
- `thirdparty-samples / python-bigquery-tests (live emulator)`
- `thirdparty-samples / node-bigquery-tests (live emulator)`
- `thirdparty-samples / python-bigquery-dataframes snippet gate (live emulator)`
- `thirdparty-samples / golang-bigquery-tests (live emulator)`

**Fast lanes (optional but recommended):**

- `ci-cpp-analysis / cpp-analysis (cppcheck)`
- `conformance-routing-matrix / routing-matrix` (`continue-on-error: true` in workflow)
- `thirdparty-golang-compile / golang-bigquery-tests (compile + skip)`

If branch protection previously required `ci / cpp-analysis (cppcheck)`, update
it to **`ci-cpp-analysis / cpp-analysis (cppcheck)`** (workflow was split out).

## Local development

# CI splits build, cc_test, and (on main) C++ coverage into `build-engine`;
# `task ci:run` still runs them sequentially on one machine. Local dev
# keeps the single-process mirror.

Docker lanes locally continue to use `task docker:smoke` (full build). CI
docker-smoke sets `DOCKER_SMOKE_SKIP_BUILD=1` after loading a pre-built image
assembled with `ENGINE_SOURCE=prebuilt`.

## Out of scope

Tag releases ([`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml)) build and
stamp their own engine with release metadata and remain independent of this
pipeline.
